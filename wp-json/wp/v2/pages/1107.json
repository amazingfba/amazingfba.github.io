In practice, a lot of my clients end up with a pretty regular slot though if you prefer that (works for me!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does that work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I use a system called ScheduleOnce &#8211; the system syncs with my diary and offers you only the slots I&#8217;m free for; you just enter 3 possible time slots over a couple of days; then I pick one &#8211; and the system books it. The system also takes account of timezone differences etc. It saves a lot of emails or Skype messages!<\/p>\n<p>Then the system sends us both reminders.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this for about two years and the system works very well and reliably.<\/p>\n<p><b>You obviously work hard mentoring &amp; running masterminds &#8211; do you still run your own Amazon businesses?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Yes absolutely &#8211; I&#8217;m still very active in the USA with one business and in Europe with another, although quite a lot of the day-to-day running has had to be delegated.<\/p>\n<p>In our European business,\u00a0 we are working on an aggressive expansion plan on Amazon, while developing our own ecommerce site to become a serious profit centre.<\/p>\n<p>I also run masterminds for experienced sellers (the<a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/10k-collective-membership-application\/\"> $10K Collective<\/a>) doing between $25k-$250k\/month and am a member of masterminds with people doing up to $1\/2 million to $1 million a month.

I&#8217;m a huge believer in learning by doing, so unless you really have no time, if you have not yet sold any products online, I will insist that you get cracking with selling something ASAP!<\/p>\n<p>Also, I work with you to get you to the point of placing a modest (probably under $1500 USD) order for generic products within 3 months.\u00a0 If you get distracted or don&#8217;t put in consistent time, that may drag out to four months.

That&#8217;s something you should be able to avoid.<\/p>\n<p>The rest mostly get buried on page 10 and are invisible to shoppers. That&#8217;s something else you should be able to see at the research stage, but sometimes a lot of sellers come into the market. That&#8217;s when speed to market combined with a greater understanding of the market, plus some smart customizations, really counts.<\/p>\n<p>If sellers don&#8217;t have a clear launch plan and or don&#8217;t\u00a0execute a vigorous launch, in a busy\/competitive market, that can guarantee mediocre sales because of being invisible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So failures\u00a0 come from low sales?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, it depends how you define failure.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the excitement of sales coming in.<\/p>\n<p>But when the dust settles and you sit down with your accountant, a slightly harder to recognised failure is failure to profit, despite sales.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Me too&#8221; products generally struggle here , ie with no personality, no differentiation from the other products in the market.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re selling a generic product with no labelling or branding, it&#8217;s going to be a price war. That may or may not leave you sales. But it will definitely hit your profitability.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you have really deep pockets, and can compete purely on volume at super low profit margins, you&#8217;re going to need to develop something unique about the product, customise the product and packaging and get some great photos. Or you&#8217;ll find there&#8217;s no profit left.<\/p>\n<p>2. If you&#8217;re selling a private labelled product (with unique packaging, logo, photos etc.) but which is frankly pretty much the same as the generic versions on Amazon, you&#8217;ll have a few more months&#8217; runway but you&#8217;ll probably end up with the same scenario.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So will ongoing mentoring be at the same price as the 1st set?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I can guarantee that whatever price is agreed at the start of the mentoring relationship, we will stick with that price for the remainder of the relationship.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/form.jotformeu.com\/72154401452345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CLICK HERE<\/a> to apply<\/p>\n<p><a style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" href=\"mailto:%20michael@amazingfba.com\">Email me\u00a0to ask more<\/a><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/calculator-23651_640.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/calculator-23651_640-191x300.png?resize=191%2C300\" alt=\"Should I invest in mentoring?\" width=\"191\" height=\"300\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>So much will it cost?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Option 1:\u00a0 4X1hour calls\/mo<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The full cost, for 4&#215;1 hour zoom calls per week,\u00a0 is usually $515\/\u00a3400 a month.
