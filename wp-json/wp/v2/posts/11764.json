Even if you don\u2019t have any product ideas of your own, you could still start a lucrative business by reselling. A reseller business is a company that purchases products direct from manufacturers or through wholesalers and clearance businesses and then sells them on to their own customers for a profit. The world of ecommerce has made it easier than ever to set up your own reseller business and if you manage it well, you stand to make a lot of money. However, there is an art to reselling and there are a few important things you need to get right. These are the 4 key elements to a successful online reseller business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"11765\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/4-key-elements-that-make-a-successful-reseller-business\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1.jpg?fit=1920%2C1056&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1056\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ecommerce-3563183_1920 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1.jpg?fit=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11765\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1.jpg?resize=300%2C165&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1.jpg?resize=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C563&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1.jpg?resize=768%2C422&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C845&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1.jpg?resize=729%2C400&amp;ssl=1 729w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-3563183_1920-1.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Picking The Right Model\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First up, you need to decide on the business model that you want to operate. Dropshipping is very popular at the moment because it\u2019s one of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/5-easiest-e-businesses-to-start-that-require-little-or-no-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">easiest E-businesses to start<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it doesn\u2019t require a huge amount of investment. Instead of handling the products yourself, you market them on your site and make sales, then the supplier delivers them directly. This makes it a lot easier because you don\u2019t need to worry about storage or delivery. Alternatively, you could set up a traditional reseller business where you buy the stock, sell it, and manage the deliveries yourself. This gives you more flexibility over where you buy the products, so you can potentially make a larger profit, but it\u2019s more work and the overheads will be higher. Think carefully about which model suits you best before starting your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Choosing A Niche<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because you aren\u2019t designing the products yourself, that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need to be knowledgeable about them. The biggest mistake people make is trying to sell anything and everything and stocking products that they are not passionate about. You will struggle to market the products if you are not an expert, so <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.buildfire.com\/en\/articles\/488850-reseller-academy-how-to-stand-out-picking-a-niche\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pick a niche<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you are interested in and do plenty of research before purchasing any products.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Finding Cheap Products<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding cheap stock is the key to maximizing your profits in a reseller business. Buying directly from manufacturers is one option, but if you really want to find good prices, you should look for wholesalers and clearance options instead. You can get some <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shonnbrotherswholesalers.co.uk\/product-category\/wholesale-clearance\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">great bargains<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, especially when you buy in bulk, and if you sell them at the average market price, you\u2019ll make a nice profit. Make sure that you search around for the best deals and don\u2019t always stick to the same supplier. Prices will fluctuate, so you should constantly be looking for the best possible deal you can find.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Invest In Marketing\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reseller businesses are all about marketing. You don\u2019t need to worry about designing or manufacturing the products, so your entire focus should be on sales. So, when setting up the business, make sure that you invest heavily in marketing. Paid ad campaigns and social media are both great places to start. It\u2019s also crucial that you set up a professional website and make the customer experience <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.co.uk\/blog\/ecommerce-customer-experience\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as smooth as possible<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you want to increase conversions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as you get these crucial elements right, you will be on the way to building a successful reseller business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>People often say that the only thing you need to start a business is passion and a great product idea, but that isn\u2019t quite true.
