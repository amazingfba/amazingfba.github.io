Well, when you have to get rid of some physical copies, it helps clarify what you really want to keep &#8211; and what doesn&#8217;t make the cut.\u00a0 I&#8217;m busy editing my business book collection prior to moving house.<br \/>\nSome books are ones I&#8217;m keeping with me. Some are going into long-term storage. And some, frankly, are off to the charity shop (really terrible ones are reserved for the recycling!)<\/p>\n<p>Here are my lists:<\/p>\n<h3>Some of My Best business books of all time<\/h3>\n<p>All links are for Amazon UK. Some links may be affiliate links.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3Pbd3yB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Simplify<\/a> by Richard Koch and Greg Lockwood &#8211; an amazing strategy level book<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3P7CEr1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Romancing the Balance Sheet<\/a> by Anil Lamba<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3P8UATa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Profit First by Mike Michalowitz<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3qA7HDD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0Financial Intelligence for Entrepreneurs<\/a> by Joe Knight and Karen Berman<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3ONBAZ9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Influence<\/a> by Robert Cialdini<\/p>\n<h3>Keepers but not top priority books<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/45FDodj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getting Things Done by Dave Allen<\/a> &#8211; a standard texton productivity but frankly I find it overly complex to actually implement.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3E8dnHT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shoe Dog<\/a> by Phil Knight (Founder of Nike)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3qFJSKx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thinking, Fast and Slow<\/a> by Daniel Kahneman<\/p>\n<h3>&#8220;All decision making is value clarification&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>My old business coach, Dan Bradbury, who&#8217;s a master NLP\u00a0 guy,\u00a0 used to say that all decision making is value clarification. I find that to be a great truth.\u00a0 Particularly deciding what you&#8217;re going to get rid of, what you&#8217;re going to keep on, what you&#8217;re going to really commit to forces you to think about what you value.<\/p>\n<p>The books you value also tell you interesting things about your focus. It seems the financial analysis books are the ones I&#8217;m most focussed on and valuing the most. While overly technical marketing books seem to be getting cut.<\/p>\n<h3>Cut, Cut, Cut!<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an e commerce business owner and you look at your catalogue honestly, and look at the numbers objectively, you&#8217;ll probably see that you should probably stop selling quite a lot of the products. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve got an emotional attachment to it much greater than any of my attachment to any of my books.<\/p>\n<p>My rucksack for my books is a very small example of a physical constraint. Amazon&#8217;s Q4 storage limits are a much bigger version of really what is fundamentally the same thing. And your capital constraints are a less physical\u00a0 (but brutally real!) constraint on what stock you can afford to carry.<\/p>\n<p>So in the end, whether it be mere secondhand books or entire product lines, being forced to cut is a wonderful discipline for any business owner.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2FBest_business_books_of_all_time_ready_to_publish.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2Fbest-business-books-of-all-time-which-books-make-the-cut-for-ecommerce%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/Best_business_books_of_all_time_ready_to_publish.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=14415-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/Best_business_books_of_all_time_ready_to_publish.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"Best_business_books_of_all_time_ready_to_publish.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 10:41 &#8212; 9.8MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 10:41 &#8212; 9.8MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSWhich are my best business books of all time?
