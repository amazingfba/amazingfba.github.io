The day was such a success that Amazon made Prime Day an annual tradition and has expanded the holiday to numerous countries including Spain, Japan, Austria, Mexico, and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Amazon has also expanded the duration of Prime Day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0In 2017, Amazon Prime Day lasted for 30 hours, whereas in 2018 Prime Day lasted for 36 hours. In 2019, <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/prime-day\/\">Prime Day<\/a> ran from July 15 through the end of July 16 making the 48-hour sale the longest in its history. Prime Day 2020 will mimic last year&#8217;s run time, offering two days of deals, beginning October 13.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Prime Day Stats (from Statista)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Number of Items purchased by Amazon Prime members during Amazon Prime Day 2018: 100M; 2019: 175M<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Do you plan to purchase anything during Amazon Prime Day 2020?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Y, know what want 6%<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Y, don\u2019t know what want 48%<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">N, 47%<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But is this all relevant? Does it mean anything to YOU?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Let\u2019s find out&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Reason no 1 why Prime Day DOESN\u2019T matter: <\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You\u2019re not selling on Amazon yet (or you sell online eg via Shopify or eBay but not on Amazon)\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is the case &#8211; but the point is that watching how much money people make on a peak day may be exciting &#8211; but it\u2019s only meaningful if it gets you off the fence one way or another. It\u2019s either when you REALLY decide to start selling or stop fantasising and actually do something else that your life moves forward&#8230;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">REASON No 2 Prime Day doesn\u2019t matter:<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0You\u2019re selling to the wrong kind of buyers. (symptom: poor <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/true-top-line-gross-revenue-vs-gross-profit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross profits<\/a>)\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now, on Amazon, buyers are the ghosts in the machine. We know they\u2019re there as every so often, they besmirch out listings with 1-star reviews or they email us to complain about something.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But we don\u2019t know anything about them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there. It means we have to\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">infer<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0things about them from their buying (and communication) behaviours.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But there IS still such a thing as attracting the wrong kind of customer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">People who expect a lot for a little; overfussy consumers; people who don\u2019t value quality and just want a low price &#8211; these may make our sales, but none of these help make us profits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">That shows up in poor pricing power; low gross profit margins.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">REASON No 3 Prime Day doesn&#8217;t matter:<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Your Business is broken (symptom:\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Company\/ Business\u00a0<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">is making a pitiful profit)\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Everyone talks about Revenue. At least, that\u2019s my experience in public in the forums and in private in the mm groups I run and others I\u2019m a member of.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Newbies bandy about averages they\u2019ve heard from others in other FB groups. Professional sellers will talk about actual gross profit margin in the confines of a mastermind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But it\u2019s the rare seller who knows and is willing to share their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business-literacy.com\/financial-concepts\/ebit-operating-profit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>operating profit<\/em><\/a> (aka pre-tax profit or even EBITDA if you will).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Btw yes I know those are not the same thing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But honestly, if your EBITDA is 4%, you\u2019re rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So does Prime Day matter at all?<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Why yes &#8211; if you have an Amazon business, you have profitable products; which attract quality buyers AND you\u2019re keeping your overhead in check such that your BUSINESS is making a profit (operating profit).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Certainly, it matters as a wave matters to a surfer. If you miss the big wave, you\u2019ll have to wait a while to make up for it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You need to ride the wave and you need the tactics and execution logistics in place.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I\u2019ll talk about that in a few minutes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">First I want to talk about\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The real meaning of Prime Day?<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are many interpretations. Here are a few:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can use anything as an excuse for a special sales day. A birthday is a good excuse. An anniversary is another.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Notice that it turns out, once it\u2019s established, the day doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Talking of day, turns out that it doesn&#8217;t have to be a day either.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What could YOU create in your business to make your own prime day equivalent?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Prime Day is a spike in sales, just like Cyber Monday and Black Friday. You\u2019ve got to prepare for it sales-wise and stockwise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What DOES Matter<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I noticed today a total ABSENCE of discussion of Prime Day in one particular place.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The otherwise active FB group for the original <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/amazon-masterminds-why\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10K collective mastermind<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Collectively those guys must be doing WELL north of a $15M a year run-rate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What they are obsessing about is operations to deal with Brexit at the moment; how to stay in stock and project it accurately; the latest trends, not on the Amazon platform, but in the market for Amazon businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In short, they aren\u2019t making it all about one day (which is, in fact, two days, obviously).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Really what matters, in short, is the overall processes in your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you have poor sales projections, poor stock projections and no cashflow projections, no individual day will save you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is about business intelligence and FORECASTING.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sort out your operations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But more than just forecasting, you need to get your OPERATIONS in control in response.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you have good marketing but poor stock control, you\u2019ll run out of inventory and miss out on sales.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you have plenty of stock but poor marketing, you\u2019ll miss out on sales and end up overstocked. (and Amazon FBA will\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">not\u00a0<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">be very forgiving of overstocking in their warehouses, given the massive pressure on their warehouses this Q4).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.business-literacy.com\/financial-concepts\/income-statement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Profit and Loss<\/a> do not equal Cashflow!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you get both right but you forgot that P&amp;L is NOT AT ALL the same as cash flow, and that, while buying inventory is just exchanging one form of current asset( cash) for another (stock) &#8211; and thus does not affect the P &amp; L &#8211; it DOES cost cash&#8230;well you might just be trading yourself broke.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Advertising is an expense (which affects both the P&amp; L\/balance and your cashflow) but it\u2019s easier to see that coming. (You did see it coming, right?)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Only if you have all of those in place, are you in a place to ride the rough but profitable seas of Amazon.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you do have them in place, you\u2019ll be able to surf the peaks and survive the troughs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These are the kinds of things the serious sellers I work with are obsessing about.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Operations aren\u2019t enough<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">By the way &#8211; if you\u2019re really smart &#8211; you\u2019ll have spotted that those are OPERATIONAL excellence aka execution. They are essential. Sadly though they are not enough.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">They are NOT going to substitute for a strategic error like trying to sell a me-too product with inadequate capitalisation in a large established market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the end, what I\u2019m trying to say today is simple: the results of a quarter matter, not the results of a Day (even if it\u2019s two days).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And those results come from getting business processes right.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And even then, you have to get the strategy right first. Sell original products or be the first mover in a market- and then dominate it. That\u2019s not the same as just following others and accepting crumbs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can\u2019t work on Prime Day. You can only use it as a test of your processes. You only get to WORK on your business\u2019s processes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Set your Sails; set your Strategy<br \/>\n<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While Prime Day\u2019s boost to sales is exciting, you can\u2019t bank sales on Amazon as a whole 3rd party market. You can only work on your strategy to make sure you try to grab a slice of the market for your company- those are the only sales you get to bank yourself!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the end, while it seems like the excitement and opportunities and answers are \u201cout there\u201d in the market, more and more, my experience tells me that this is not so.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">First of all, the worthy, exciting challenges and opportunities are in the market that is COMING, not already here. It\u2019s not about getting excited about today; it\u2019s about seeing around the corner into the next quarter and seeing the challenges that are coming.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>External opportunity vs Internal Competence<\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The real opportunity though, as I learn more gradually about how the dynamics of business work, is in your creative response to those challenges and opportunities &#8211; in other words, your ability to strategically choose your battleground, and then, ahead of time, to put in place marketing, stock control and financial tactics. Only when the waves of the market hit your business &#8211; the peaks of opportunity, the troughs of challenges &#8211; will you find out whether you\u2019re going to make a killing or take a drubbing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There\u2019s a reason that companies originated in the days of global sea voyages by merchant adventurers. It may be a metaphor but it\u2019s a more apt one than clicking on a mouse and expecting a result. Leave that sort of thinking to the impulse-driven consumers of Prime Day (which may, of course, include you and indeed myself today- I do need a new monitor, at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be telling my wife&#8230;)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you like sitting and clicking, this may be a shock. If you like a more bracing challenge, then you\u2019ll find yourself in the rarer company of true adventurers. Such are the people of the masterminds I\u2019m proud to be convening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0If you want to join the ranks of the business adventurers, it helps to enjoy a bracing squall with the confidence you have a shipshape craft and a well-trained crew. If you\u2019re not there yet, stop worrying about the opportunity and start getting your ship in order. It will be time and effort that should pay off next time there\u2019s a wave to catch&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F419_Why_Prime_Day_probably_doesn_t_matter_whole_episode.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2Fwhy-prime-day-doesnt-matter%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/419_Why_Prime_Day_probably_doesn_t_matter_whole_episode.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=10621-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/419_Why_Prime_Day_probably_doesn_t_matter_whole_episode.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"419_Why_Prime_Day_probably_doesn_t_matter_whole_episode.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 13:29 &#8212; 12.3MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 13:29 &#8212; 12.3MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSIf you\u2019re listening to this in 2020 and it\u2019s October 13 or 14 2020, you\u2019re in the middle of Prime Day.
