Often, they end up staying wannapreneurs, meaning they never actually make any revenue. Revenue is how you can tell if you have a business! Even spending money is a good sign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most Amazon power sellers seem to get excited about the idea of the business opportunity. And, as I confess I did, they even get seduced by the idea of passive income and the fact that you don&#8217;t have to exchange time for money. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2:14 &#8211; What is your vision for the<\/b><b><i> customer<\/i><\/b><b>?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the would-be entrepreneurs at this stage have an idea of what they can have for themselves, but here\u2019s what they don\u2019t have: they don&#8217;t have a vision of what they&#8217;re going to give to the world. In fact, they&#8217;re very, very vague in most cases about that. They thrash around using tools and other people\u2019s systems to try and substitute for imagination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When I\u2019m working with clients &#8211; whether mentoring clients or in the<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Private Label Process course<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; I also try to get entrepreneurs to start by having a vision of a particular person with a particular pain. In fact, vision is a rather general word for that; they need to be very specific. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this is you, ask yourself: what is it you really know about? What do you really care about? Let&#8217;s get very, very specific before you go out and rely on tools to do stuff for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a way even then, rather than saying that vision is wrong, it&#8217;s not about vision is wrong, is that their vision isn&#8217;t strong enough. Sure, they have a vision for themselves, of sitting on a beach using their laptop (which is an absurd idea, by the way, I&#8217;ve never done it, they have sand on beaches, it&#8217;s not a good mix!). But they <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019t <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have a vision of what their business offers the world. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>14:00 &#8211; Camp 2: \u201cAction without Vision\u201d<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second level is the Amazon power sellers who are doing stuff! They&#8217;ve had the chutzpah, the courage, to be part of the small percentage, who actually sell anything on Amazon. It\u2019s probably the 80\/20 of the 80\/20 of the people who have the idea of selling on Amazon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They actually do sell on Amazon, but then they&#8217;re stuck in the nightmare. They did their market research; they\u2019ve ordered the product; \u00a0they\u2019ve tried their best to ensure product quality; they did their branding work in the sense that the superficial aspects of the b<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rand, the visible aspects, meaning they have a logo that looks nice and have good packaging. And, you know, maybe they have a nice strapline or whatever, on the packaging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, they&#8217;re struggling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I think the reason they&#8217;re struggling is because they&#8217;ve taken a lot of action, which is great, and they&#8217;ll learn from that. But what they need to learn from that is, okay, now I&#8217;ve tried selling a \u201cme-too\u201d product. Let\u2019s not do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, they&#8217;ve learned a lot of the mechanics of how to do something on Amazon, and how to order from China and so forth. Now, mechanics really matter. Having a system to really read the marketplace and crunch the numbers are critical. You need to use tools for ordering from China; getting proper negotiation systems and principles in place. practicing proper Supply Chain Management including quality control; measuring financial numbers; having a launch strategy and a very precise set of tactics. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this is not a vision<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> versus<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mechanics fight. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advantage the second set of people have is they understand the mechanics because they&#8217;ve done it what they need to do. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m working with a couple of clients right now who are doing about $10,000 a month, something like that \uffe110,000 and they&#8217;re struggling. The profits are struggling because they\u2019ve got \u201cme too\u201d products. And we&#8217;re going to work now on maybe looking at a parallel niche, one that&#8217;s not too far away from what they are already selling. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>18:28 &#8211; Start with who you are<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you should start with who you are, is my big hint. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re wondering what to sell, look at who you are, what you buy a lot of what you&#8217;re an expert consumer in at least if you&#8217;re an expert producer of it, even better. If you have a supply chain management experience. Some people do, or you made something yourself, fantastic. But if you&#8217;re an expert consumer, in the sense that you buy a lot of stuff, and you&#8217;re very passionate and knowledgeable, and you&#8217;re obsessed with the detail, which is really where the details are so important when you&#8217;re getting a good product and differentiating it. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>20:57 &#8211; Camp 3: \u201cAction lead by Vision\u201d<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"6175\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/312-amazon-power-sellers\/concept-1868728_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/concept-1868728_640.jpg?fit=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 70D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;32&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.008&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"concept-1868728_640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/concept-1868728_640.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/concept-1868728_640.jpg?fit=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-6175 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/concept-1868728_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/concept-1868728_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/concept-1868728_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third level up is the classic <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/10k\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10k collective<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Million Pound Mastermind member. This means have had the vision, got going, sold on Amazon. In fact, some people have been selling for generations, but they&#8217;ve only come on to the e-commerce space when the last few years or even a few months. Some Amazon power sellers came from completely different backgrounds but have come into the e-commerce space. \u00a0Comparing them to the \u201cvision without action\u201d camp, it has to be said it helps to have some kind of business background because you&#8217;re more likely to pull the trigger and take action and therefore you&#8217;ll learn by experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&#8217;s fascinating to me about those Amazon power sellers is the discussions are getting more and more what you might think of as abstract. Except that these guys are making real revenue, a million pounds just before Christmas, \u00a3170K in December, \u00a0\u00a380,000 pounds etc. So real money is being made here; it&#8217;s not a separation between vision and action; these guys are big on both.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Koch explained a lot of the right principles of market domination in his incredible <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/dp\/B00371V6Q6\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Star Principle<\/a>\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is becoming a bible for the 10K Collective and Million Pound Mastermind. He also wrote a more complex book called<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cSimple Strategy\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> back in the mid-1990s. \u00a0So my take on strategy from that is the interaction between vision and where your marketplaces are or what you&#8217;re talking about. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, one member of the 10k collective has been working on creating incredible Instagram marketing for their business and they&#8217;ve done some of it but they realized what they were doing. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>25:38 &#8211; Clear vision is the blueprint for success<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/idea-1855598_640.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"6176\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/312-amazon-power-sellers\/idea-1855598_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/idea-1855598_640.jpg?fit=640%2C285&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,285\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"idea-1855598_640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/idea-1855598_640.jpg?fit=300%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/idea-1855598_640.jpg?fit=640%2C285&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-6176 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/idea-1855598_640.jpg?resize=300%2C134&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"134\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/idea-1855598_640.jpg?resize=300%2C134&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/idea-1855598_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>But business thinking is a very, very clear vision. If I say the word vision means a blueprint, if you are Michelangelo making a sculpture, you see very clearly when you look at a block of marble you see in your mind&#8217;s eye precisely how the end statue looks like. That&#8217;s not a vague idea. It\u2019s not a kind of cloud field, blurry vision, it&#8217;s a crystalline crystal clear vision. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, that&#8217;s easier, because it&#8217;s just him. I don&#8217;t personally know about marble sculpture, but business is equally fascinating to me because it&#8217;s more interactive. I guess that&#8217;s why as a musician that I&#8217;ve always tended towards interactive modes of things. I&#8217;m no solo pianist, I was never good enough. But I&#8217;ve done a lot of accompanying singers and when you&#8217;re working with other people who are conducting orchestras, there are so many moving parts is never quite what you think it&#8217;s going to be. And for me, that&#8217;s what makes it fascinating, that interactivity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s why I love the <a href=\"\/10k\">10k collective mastermind<\/a> and the Million Pound Mastermind. That&#8217;s why also businesses so fascinating because you have your vision, you find your team, they have a slightly different vision, sometimes better, sometimes worse. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you put a product in the marketplace, sometimes the customers hate what you thought was going to be great. And sometimes they love some random little feature that you didn&#8217;t think was important. And that&#8217;s what makes it fascinating. It really is a fascinating game. I love it. It&#8217;s intellectually stimulating, but it&#8217;s you with skin in the game so it\u2019s not abstract. It\u2019s like sport meets chess. For me, this is why business is exciting for me. And this is why I think that tension between vision and mechanics between vision and action is ultimately creative tension. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>27:37 &#8211; Enjoy the game &#8211; or leave it!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And you\u2019ve got to love that. The <a href=\"\/10k\">10k collective<\/a> and Million Pound Mastermind members are really, really up for the game, they enjoy the game, they love it, they want to get in there. It&#8217;s like a great rugby player or a boxer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They want to get in there and be amongst it. They are competitors. Of course, they want to win but they enjoy the game itself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Victorians said, \u201cThe game is the thing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The last thing I\u2019d say is: if you&#8217;re not enjoying the game, play a different game. I was forced to play rugby at school. I haven&#8217;t played it since because it&#8217;s not my game; I\u2019m not built for it. But I go jogging. I really love it. And it&#8217;s a great way to listen to podcasts for me. It&#8217;s time to listen to some exciting business input and get inspired and enjoy the feeling of using my body at the same time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So everyone has their game. If Amazon isn&#8217;t your game, don&#8217;t play the game. It&#8217;s fine. Amazon is not for everyone. But whatever it is, find the game that you enjoy playing it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get a clear vision of who you&#8217;re going to help (and that takes time to develop that is in itself is work). Develop a vision. Then get in there, take action, enjoy taking action, enjoy the game.
