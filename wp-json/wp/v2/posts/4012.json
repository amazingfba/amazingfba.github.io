There is a lot potential for sellers that are willing to put in the effort.<\/p>\n<h2>John\u2019s Background<\/h2>\n<p>John started as an engineer doing independent contracting. It wasn\u2019t the life he wanted. He was looking for more money and more freedom, so he sourced his first product at the end of 2014 and went live the following February. Now he lives in Vietnam.<\/p>\n<h2>The Potential of Amazon Europe<\/h2>\n<p>Once he built his team and put more focus on Amazon Europe rather than just in the UK, his business took off. Amazon Europe is still rather untouched, so sellers can gain traction much more quickly than in more mature markets the US or UK. He looked at a case study where a seller was doing 30-40k a month and their product had about 13 reviews. Even products that you wouldn\u2019t consider are still viable. Think garlic presses or silicone spatulas.<\/p>\n<p>Always have your items listed in the other countries even if you\u2019re not pushing it. An item that is really competitive in Germany may still get 5 sales a day in France or Italy with no reviews just because it\u2019s there.<\/p>\n<h2>The Three-Step Process to go from the US to Amazon Europe<\/h2>\n<p>The first step is to get your VAT, which could take a couple months. This is the sales tax information which allows you to import good into the UK. You can get help at <a href=\"http:\/\/fbafrontiers.com\/vat\">fbafrontiers.com\/vat<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The second step is to do your research. It\u2019s similar to what you would do in the US only you have to treat each marketplace as a separate market. If you have ASINs in the US or UK, you would just work backward. Get your main keywords and put them into the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and rank them as an opportunity. Look at the top sellers and look at the number of reviews, feedback, or if they\u2019re actually selling something.<\/p>\n<p>The last step is to get listed. If you\u2019re in the UK, get your translations done right away and get listed. If your product is in the US, pick your top one or two SKUs and get some stock into the UK. This might not be the best-selling SKUs, but the ones that you think will do best in Europe. If your best product is in a niche, there might not be enough volume to make it worth it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_203\">\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/fbafrontiers\">Get access to FBA Frontiers<\/a> to begin your journey of selling in Amazon Europe!<\/strong><\/div>\n<h2>\u00a0VAT Simplified<\/h2>\n<p>VAT is part sales tax and part import tax. The UK government views imports as a sale and taxes it at 20%. So, if you are bringing in items from China and each unit costs $10, the UK gets $2. However, this is reclaimable against the final sale. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re selling it for $100. You would list it as $120 because you need to collect $20 for the tax, but you would only pay $18 since you paid the $2 on import.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s relatively simple once you get your head around it, but you\u2019ll have a VAT agent to take care of it. You can get a good deal through at <a href=\"http:\/\/fbafrontiers.com\/vat\">fbafrontiers.com\/vat<\/a> or you can pick any agent you want. They\u2019ll do the paperwork for you. If you have an item, you can go to <a href=\"http:\/\/fbafrontiers.com\/calculator\">fbafrontiers.com\/calculator<\/a> to figure out what the cost will be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If<\/strong><strong> you want to know more, check out this article on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sourcing-monster.com\/amazon-fba-cost-calculator-all-you-need-to-know\/\">Reviewing the best Amazon FBA Calculator.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Registering in Amazon Europe<\/h2>\n<p>Once you start selling in the UK, you\u2019ll be pestered by Amazon to register for Pan European FBA.\u00a0 Pan European means that they can freely move bulk boxes of your inventory throughout the five main markets, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and the UK. They can also store your inventory in Poland on the Czech Republic. So, you\u2019ll need 7 VAT numbers; one for each country your product may be stored. This is something that your VAT agent can take care of. Just be sure to negotiate their fees.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon charges you for this service. However, once you\u2019re moving more than 400 or so items, it\u2019s cheaper than moving them yourself.<\/p>\n<h2>Keyword Research<\/h2>\n<p>If you are selling in the US, the keyword research would be the same for the UK. You should do some reverse ASIN searches on something like Keyword Inspector to ensure you don\u2019t miss obvious translation like diaper to nappy. For the other marketplaces, the tools work the same. Even for PPC, it would be the same strategy. In France and Italy, you could probably just run broad campaigns and they\u2019d do just as well because it is so non-competitive.<\/p>\n<h2>Translation<\/h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges will be the translation of the listings. That is something that will be covered in the <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/231\">next episode<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_203\">\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/Fbafrontiers\">FBAFrontiers<\/a> is a great course for Amazon sellers that know how to sell on Amazon and are looking into expanding into Europe.
