but \u00a0what was your start in entrepreneurship?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam has been an entrepreneur for over 20 years. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam\u00a0got started right out of high school. He knew he didn\u2019t want a boss and was captivated by the idea of entrepreneurship. He has had several businesses but not focuses solely on Amazon. He has had online and offline businesses including a flight simulator business, hair salon, and a finance company. He has a very diverse background, to say the least. Selling on Amazon FBA came more recently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How did you come to be selling on Amazon FBA?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam got into selling on Amazon FBA part-time while he was running an animation business. He sold that business last year and moved away from service businesses in order to start a product business with Amazon. Part of the allure of products is that it gets away from the \u201cselling your time\u201d type job where you make more money the longer you work. With products, once you do the hard work and develop the product, you can sell it all over the world and get paid over and over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His animation business was growing and financially successful but he had a lot of people\u00a0and a lot of moving parts. With products, it so leveraged and you can get away from that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What made you decide to sell things on Amazon FBA specifically?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a business guy, Adam found Amazon very impressive. It\u2019s a phenomenal company. In terms of their growth and numbers you know they are doing it right. He really loved that you didn\u2019t have to build a website, that you didn\u2019t have to find the customers because they were already there\u00a0and that they handle fulfillment and shipping. FBA just changed the rules of product distribution. It was appealing to sell into the biggest markets in the world from wherever you were. To get more of Adam&#8217;s thoughts on the Amazon opportunity,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/online.reliable.education\/free-amazon-training-course1?affiliate_id=516769&amp;aff_sub=Show%20notes%20(blog)&amp;aff_sub2=Facebook%20Group&amp;nopopup=false&amp;noautoplay=false\">CLICK HERE<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Do you think it\u2019s too late to get started with selling on Amazon FBA?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It definitely isn\u2019t according to Adam. He did an experiment this year. He started with 6 products that launched in February or March to test what it would be like for a newcomer. They are currently around a million dollar a year products at this point. So it isn\u2019t too late. There is a lot of opportunity to those with the necessary education.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Where do you think the opportunity is? Is it still in .com in the US, or has it shifted to somewhere else? How about <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\">selling on Amazon FBA UK<\/a>?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s interesting because right now his European business is doing about 70% of his US business. What\u2019s truly amazing is that his cost-per-customer (CPC) in Europe \u00a0is about \u2153 \u00a0of what it is in the US. Also, Europeans give more feedback than Americans. He has automated emails that go out and he gets about twice as many emails from UK residents than the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Are you only in the US and European markets or are you in others?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam is in .com and then Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and the UK.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are the big pros and cons of the US market versus Amazon FBA UK and the other European markets?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US is always appealing because it\u2019s so big but because it\u2019s so big means there is a lot more competition. Also, America is home many of the Amazon course gurus that have pumped out a lot of courses to those wanting to start an Amazon business. The challenge is that there are a lot of sellers that have been educated on the same strategy at the same time. So America is still a great opportunity if you have the right education and the right lens. You can\u2019t beat the US market because it\u2019s so big and broad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you live in the UK and feel more comfortable working there, Adam would recommend starting in the UK. It\u2019s a fantastic market, much easier to access, much easier to rank, and a much more appreciative group of consumers. However, if you don\u2019t live in the US or the UK Adam recommends starting in the US because it\u2019s much easier to get started. The regulations for foreign sellers are a lot tougher in the UK and it\u2019s a lot easier to get your account set up in the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue is that not everyone is registered for VAT and many people won\u2019t until Amazon requires it because it will add 20% to your prices and put those that register at a disadvantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>You mentioned before how everyone was educated in\u00a0the same flawed strategies for selling on Amazon. How were they flawed and what should be done differently?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest promoters put out a course telling people to sell items for under $40 with high Best Seller Ranking. When they first launched they recommend being in the top 100 of any category. Once they began selling this idea they realized they needed to expand because they had 5000 people looking to be a top 100 in about 15 categories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of their flaws was the emphasis on BSR because it doesn\u2019t really matter. That only measure who sells the most. But in business, it doesn\u2019t matter how much you sell, rather how much margin you make. That\u2019s the difference between turnover and leftover. Adam is looking for higher margin, less contested spaces. People don\u2019t realize how massive Amazon is. Over 2 million sellers with hundreds of millions of products. There are a lot of unsophisticated sellers that have two images with ten reviews and are on page one. There are a lot of small sellers that looked for cheap products with high turnover where anyone can get into it. What Adam looks for is something that is difficult for people to compete and isn\u2019t as obvious.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_19\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=19\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are some things you would suggest in order to put a moat around things? If you have $5000, $10,000 and $20,000 to start.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam cover a lot of this in his course at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/online.reliable.education\/free-amazon-training-course1?affiliate_id=516769&amp;aff_sub=Show%20notes%20(blog)&amp;aff_sub2=Facebook%20Group&amp;nopopup=false&amp;noautoplay=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reliable.education<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. His first product was $160 retail. But it was costing him $40 a unit. So there was an $80 margin which gave him options someone selling a $12 product just doesn\u2019t have. He could spend more on advertising. Even if he spent $20 per sale he was still making $60. He was completely out of the top sellers and in his subcategory there was around 45,000 and he was nowhere near the top. He still came in and started making $15,000 a month in sales and $8,000 profit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Differentiate your product to sell stuff on Amazon<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing people need to think about is that whenever you look at a market for anything, you need to think about it from a consumer&#8217;s point of view. Why will a consumer notice you? And why would a consumer buy from you and not someone else? It can\u2019t be something they need to read about. Don\u2019t expect them to read your copy and find some feature. Think of Amazon like Tinder. People put in a few details about what they are looking for, then go through the pictures and start dismissing them. You need to have good photographs, but you also need something good in the photograph. So try to get something that is visually different. Some key detail or feature that will grab the buyer\u2019s attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you look up<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=desktop+calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> desktop calculators<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Amazon, they are all black or grey except for one that is green. Now if you look at car covers, they are all black or grey or blue. But if someone came with a car cover that had a cool saying, or was bright pink, it\u2019s going to stand out. The question is, how can you innovate, visually, at the core design level. It\u2019s not about the best title or description, anyone can do that. The big thing is to think like a customer. Just follow Jeff Bezos advice, \u201cBe in business for the customer.\u201d In the end, the best products are going to win.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To\u00a0get more advice or free training from Adam, just go to <a href=\"https:\/\/online.reliable.education\/free-amazon-training-course1?affiliate_id=516769&amp;aff_sub=Show%20notes%20(blog)&amp;aff_sub2=Facebook%20Group&amp;nopopup=false&amp;noautoplay=false\">reliable.education<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Of course, it would be appalling of me not to mention my very own Private Label Process paid Amazon Selling Course that gives you access to in depth proven strategies for selling on Amazon UK and across the global Amazon Marketplaces.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re UK based and looking for an <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\">Amazon FBA Course for UK<\/a> and European Marketplaces, or the USA, Japan or the emerging marketplaces &#8211;
