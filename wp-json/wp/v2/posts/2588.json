If you\u2019re an American seller, the logical second step would be to set up in England, and vice versa for English sellers.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve done that and you\u2019re at the point where you have 10-20 products selling well in the English and\/or American market, then it\u2019s time. You need to strategize which market in Amazon Europe is interesting for your some of your products. Gil says it would probably be Germany, but afterward start looking at France, Spain, and Italy. He recommends looking at it as a whole picture. It\u2019s already hard to set up so you might as well go for all the markets.<\/p>\n<p>However, don\u2019t think you can slap everything you have in America on the German market. You have to have a good look at the products and the market. Use BSR knowledge and professional help to get the listings translated and do the marketing. Gil uses a tool called Amalyze, which helps him monitor his PPC. Right now it only works in Germany. This is one area where he suggests getting professional help. It\u2019s surprising to see how many American sellers have only American words in their PPC, which doesn\u2019t help them with German consumers.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re going to make the effort to go somewhere, you might as well make the whole effort. It\u2019s going to be an effort for the American seller to sell as a whole, so you might as well consider all of the marketplaces, go to town and do it properly when selling on Amazon Europe.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">Things to be Aware of for Americans Selling on Amazon Europe<\/h2>\n<p>Some of the things American needs to think about from the start are how they structure their company, where they pay their taxes and whether they will use the Pan-European FBA program or not. In Europe, even though there are different countries and different marketplaces, they\u2019re all part of the European Union (at the time of recording.)<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to start selling in Europe, get somebody to tell you about the Pan-Eu program and how it works with VAT tax before you set up shop. After that is done, and you\u2019re registered, get somebody to help translate and do the listings, customer support and marketing efforts in their language. If you are selling 5 or more products, you are really selling a brand. Don\u2019t destroy your brand image by selling in Germany with weird translations and getting bad reviews.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">Apply the Pareto Principle to your Portfolio<\/h2>\n<p>Gil helps people navigate the difficulties with branching out into the German marketplace. So far he has worked with people who were already registered in Germany, had their account going there and also in the rest of Europe. They started by looking at their whole portfolio of what they were selling in America and, based on the 80-20 rule, figured out which would be the best 20% of products to start selling in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>They followed the process that was discussed in <a href=\"http:\/\/amazginfba.com\/189\">Part 1 of this interview<\/a>: get it translated, put the keywords in, launch and start PPC. After doing this with just the top 20% of products, they added more and more products to the European market for them. However, they didn\u2019t do this for their whole portfolio because not all the products make sense.<\/p>\n<h3>Tailor Your Listings to the Consumers<\/h3>\n<p>Some things don\u2019t translate well due to climate differences, such as camping gear, which doesn\u2019t do well in the UK but does really well in Germany. Also sometimes it\u2019s due to cultural differences. For example, tablecloths do really well in Spain because the Spanish value their formal family meals. Even though it\u2019s a very small market, the product does much better there than even the rest of Europe.<\/p>\n<p>For Gil\u2019s sports brand, he does sell across Europe, however, 70% of that revenue comes from Germany. The rest is divided by France, Italy, and Spain, and does not include the UK. For one of his clients, France and Spain took a larger cut, up to 30% and Germany was 60%, while Italy and the UK made up 10%. Germany will be the strongest market and in comparison to England, it will likely be the easier market. Do your research as it depends on the product as well as exchange rates of various currencies (e.g. Pound to Euro compared with Dollar to Euro).<\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_145\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=145\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">Advantages for a UK-Based Seller<\/h2>\n<p>Gil\u2019s general advice is to just try it out. As a UK seller, you can even export from the UK, without having to get a VAT number or anything. Get a German listing, list on the German market, optimize all of that for your 3 best products and they\u2019ll probably be less competitive than in England. Find somebody professional to help you with the translation and optimization. Give it a real chance to work, and test it from there.<\/p>\n<p>Start with your 3 best products, and then over time, you can either decide to get the rest of your products into Germany or expand those first 3 products to Spain, France, and Italy. By the time you have 1000 orders per month all over Europe it\u2019s time to get PanEU going because you save that <span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">\u20ac<\/span>1 on every order. Test out Germany and take it from there. You can store your inventory in the UK and send it to any Amazon buyers in Europe without a big risk. You only pay a little bit extra for the export.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re just starting out, under a revenue volume of <span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">\u20ac<\/span>30,000-70,000 and not VAT registered yet, it\u2019s not an issue because as long as you aren\u2019t storing things in the EU you don\u2019t have to register for VAT. In the UK it\u2019s <span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">\u00a3<\/span>83,000 so VAT is something you can afford to worry about down the line if you\u2019re just starting out.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=145\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">The Pan-EU FBA Program<\/h2>\n<p>For those more advanced, Pan EU involves VAT registration in a number of countries. Gil does have a PanEU program for his sports brand because he has more orders than 1000 per month and is selling everywhere. Just from a numbers perspective it already makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>The PanEU FBA program means instead of shipping from one location, Amazon can store the product anywhere in Europe. If you store something somewhere in Europe, then you need to be VAT registered in that country. That\u2019s how it works. If you want to do PanEU, you do need to register in France, Italy, Spain, Germany, England, Poland and the Czech Republic. Gil stresses that you cannot do this part yourself. Trying to get in contact with the financial departments of all 7 countries and complete all the paperwork on your own isn\u2019t a good idea, so Gil works together with a German partner for that, or he suggests the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.avalara.com\/\">Avalara<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Cost of PanEU<\/h3>\n<p>The whole package for Gil for the first year was <span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">\u20ac<\/span>3000, but that includes the registration in all the countries and the monthly fee for doing his VAT. They won\u2019t transfer the cash for you. Once a month, Gil gets all the VAT numbers and transfer the money to 8 different countries. It\u2019s complicated but he is very happy with his online banking options with his bank. He recommends you check this with your bank in advance. If your bank says you cannot transfer money to Poland then there\u2019s a problem. But there are companies that can help you with that.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a slight admin headache, but there is advantages of doing things using Pan-Eu FBA. First, you will have a better time of Prime. Even if you export and it says Prime, it tells the people who buy it that it will take 3 days and is shipped from England. Most people agree the Amazon algorithm will push your product a little more if you\u2019re available in one day. So if somebody in France buys it and it\u2019s already there in France in the fulfillment center, it\u2019s an advantage. Plus, every order you do that doesn\u2019t use Pan-Eu is <span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">\u20ac<\/span>1 extra.<\/p>\n<h2>German Specific Regulations<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s tricky to stay in touch with German consumers. By law, it\u2019s not allowed to send any commercial email without double opt-in. Amazon has a double opt-in, but you as a seller do not. You\u2019re not allowed to send any emails that contain anything commercial. Even asking for a review or feedback is considered commercialized mail and is not allowed. The only email you can send is when you send the invoice. However, even in that one, you can\u2019t ask for reviews or feedback. If you obey the rules in Germany, you\u2019re not really allowed to have any follow-up contact with your customers. However, a lot of people do skirt this or blatantly ignore this rule.<\/p>\n<p>This does explain why there are so few reviews on German listings compared with similar products with a similar volume of sales in the UK. Either you still do it or you find a way to know your customer. For example, you can go to Facebook groups for your target market, reach out and get opt-ins that way. You can do Facebook ads to an opt-in funnel, for a coupon code for example. Then you will get the customer\u2019s double opt-in. Then you can communicate with them.<\/p>\n<p>Accounts don\u2019t get suspended for sending follow up emails. Amazon doesn\u2019t really care about it so much, but it\u2019s the German law. You would get a letter that says you should not do that anymore and have to pay a fine. It\u2019s like a Cease and Desist letter along with a fine. It\u2019s sent by lawyers, usually coming from your competitors. The fine is <span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\">\u20ac<\/span>500-1000 as a general rule. It\u2019s always the question of risk vs. reward and for many. A fine is preferable to an account suspension for anyone doing serious numbers.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">The Future of Amazon Europe<\/h2>\n<p>Gil believes Germany has probably finished a big percentage of its growth curve. Although the German market will keep growing it won\u2019t be at the pace as it did over recent years. Over the next year or two, Amazon Spain, Italy and France will probably start growing. That\u2019s assuming Amazon focuses on growing the markets there, but the whole of Europe will keep growing overall. This means that now is an awesome time to get involved and get some shelf space in Amazon Europe.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">See Michael and Gil Speak<\/h2>\n<p>On 5\u00a0July, Gil and Michael are speaking at the Amazon Event run by Web Retailer Andy Geldman.
