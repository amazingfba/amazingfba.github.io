Greg saw an opportunity while he was selling. He hated doing the prep work. It took a lot of time and kept him away from what actually made him money, sourcing and working with suppliers. So he started <a href=\"http:\/\/fbaprepuk.com\/\">FBA Prep UK<\/a> almost two years ago as a solution for Amazon sellers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why bother with prep at all? Why not just send directly from China or supplier to Amazon?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First of all, things happen to products. It\u2019s more common with air, there\u2019s a lot more handling and a lot more opportunity for packaging to be damaged. From the supplier not doing what their supposed to, then sending it to the plane, loading and unloading from the plane, then to the Amazon warehouse.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Sometimes the products show up without packaging. It may have been repackaged by the shipping company because it was in such bad shape. Amazon won\u2019t accept that. They have very high standards for what they expect and if it arrives damaged, they will not accept it. It will either be removed or destroyed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">T<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">o avoid all this, you\u2019ll want the products to be inspected before they go to the warehouse. You can do this yourself but you will soon realize how much time and effort it takes to go through everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">So what prep do you need to do for Amazon?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Obviously, <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">everything<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"> will have to have a scan-able barcode, <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">i.e. EAN or UPC work fine. Most products that come from China do so in a poly-bad or a plain white box with no identification on it. Amazon cannot accept that. They are a massive operation that cannot deviate from their processes. Prep companies, being smaller and working with you directly, have the flexibility to ensure the products are packaged correctly before Amazon gets them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">F<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">or the items that come in the poly-bag, can you repack those?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">These bags are quite brittle and are too thin so they don\u2019t meet Amazon standards. They have to be sealed or they have to have a suffocation warning label is the opening is more than 5 \u00bd inches. These aren\u2019t Chinese regulations, so unless you specifiably request this, it won\u2019t be done. Sometimes it won\u2019t happen if you do specify it.<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"> Keep in mind that your supplier is likely not to comply with your instructions. There is very little chance of getting your money back should they mess up. Typically the only recourse is a discount on your next shipment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">If you hire an inspection company and everything checks out at the factory, what are some other things that can go wrong?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">If it\u2019s in a poly-bag, it\u2019s pretty much ok. The problem starts if you have it in a box that gets thrown in to a shipping container. By sea is better because there is less handling. It doesn\u2019t get handled much until it arrives gets put on a pallet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Greg recommends contacting the supplier and having them ship extra boxes. Many times some of them will get hit by a forklift and the packaging gets messed up which will be rejected by Amazon. The products are fine but because the box is messed up it becomes unsaleable. If you don\u2019t have extra boxes you have to contact the supplier after the fact. The supplier will likely not send you the extras until your next shipment which leaves you with 10-15% of your products sitting around until you\u2019re ready to order again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Greg\u2019s standards are whether or not he would be happy to receive it. If he order an item off Amazon, would he be happy to receive it in that condition? If not, he would send it in until it gets repacked. This is also to protect you. Amazon shoppers are picky. They will rate a product low based on the packaging. Even if the product is great but the packaging was awful, they might leave a poor review. So it\u2019s worth it to wait to send it in rather than risk a poor review.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">So if you bother with prep, why use a Prep company?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It depends on your circumstances. Whether or not you have the space and means of handling them. Make sure to receive the samples at home so you have a change to inspect them before making a large purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Some people don\u2019t realize how large their orders are. So when you try to prep 100 or 150 units, you realize that you don\u2019t want to be doing that for 500 or 1000. 1000 units, you\u2019re probably looking at a pallet. You have to make sure you have a place to put a pallet.<\/p>\n<p>Greg had a customer call him one time about 2000 piece order that was about to dock and he was told that it was going to be two maybe three pallets. He hadn\u2019t realize how large it was going to be and was planning on fitting it in his two-bedroom flat on the 16th floor. This would not have been remotely possible to do on his own. He had to have the help of a prep company that has the means to handle such an order.<\/p>\n<p>Also, this is almost required for some sellers that do it as a side gig and they have full-time jobs and they do their sourcing and dealing with suppliers in the evening. They have no time to be messing with prep work because they have their full-time job. It\u2019s not feasible for them to do it on their own.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">What are the main steps you go through to <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">p<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">repare for Amazon?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Check cartons<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Unpack &amp; Check boxes<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Inspect outer cartons and items themselves<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">FNSKU barcodes<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Have a report\/structured record<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Inbound Shipping to Amazon<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">What are the biggest mistakes you\u2019ve found sellers make with freight that you\u2019ve come across?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The story before, about the guy that didn\u2019t know what he was going to do when it arrived. There is a scam going around <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">where the supplier offers you shipping terms. They offer FOB prices to the port in China and CIF prices Felixstowe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">To clarify some terms, FOB is \u201cFreight on Board\u201d. The Chinese will pay the <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">expenses<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"> to get your goods from their factory to the port of departure. CIF, Carriage, insurance and freight, is the exact same thing to the UK ports. So they exported the products, put it on a boat, and it will arrive at the docks in Felixstowe or South Hampton. From dockside, you have to organize onward freight and customs <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">clearance.<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"> In Greg\u2019s experience he got the same <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">price<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"> for FOB in China <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">and the CIF in the UK. It got to the UK and it seemed like it was all a part of the service, but after talking to he Freight Forwarding partner he was told it was a scam. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">When it gets to the UK, the handling agents have to pay the shipping charge. It\u2019s not free, it just gets passed on the UK agents who then pass it on to you. You then, also have to pay your normal VAT import duties, and custom clearance duty fee. He has heard figures of <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">\u00a3<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">600-1000 just to release the product. If you don\u2019t pay them, you don\u2019t get your product. They then start charging you storage fees and the costs just start rising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">What are the warning signs to look out for?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The supplier will offer you terms that look remarkably good. \u201cIf it looks too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d Ask for prices from other freight forwarders. Even if it just to give you an indication of what the cost might be and if the Chinese guys stack up and looks about the same, you should be fine. But if it\u2019s considerably cheaper, then at least you know what prices you can expect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">What are some basic dos and don\u2019ts of working with a prep company?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The biggest thing is trust. At the end of the day, you\u2019re sending a large investment, thousands of pounds worth of product, to someone you don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know if they exist. As an entity, they could just be a website and an email address and you end up sending your stuff to them. Make sure your happy with them, <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">call them up, look for social proof. Just make sure you\u2019re real.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Keep in mind they are an extension of you, they\u2019re not the importer on record. They don\u2019t have importing responsibilities, they are simply a delivery point for you. You need to tell your supplier that. Greg has gotten invoices coming in with his name on them. Then DHL, or whichever shipping company will send him an invoice for the duties. He will send that on to the customer, but the invoice is in his name. So that makes it difficult for the customer to put it in their accounts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Even if you\u2019re out of the country, they will be your delivery point. So it will be your name, your company, at their address. So the invoice will go to the prep company who will then forward it to you. If it\u2019s been agreed, they will pay the duties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Tell them it coming. As ridiculous as it sounds, inform them of it\u2019s arrival. The worst thing for Greg is to receive six pallets of products and have no idea who it belongs to. All they have is his name on the invoice.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Product Prep with Greg Jones of FBA Prep UK<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=urfYfg0m_Uk&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F_79_How_to_prep_for_Amazon_UK_-_with_Greg_Jones.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F79-how-to-prep-for-amazon-uk-with-greg-jones-part-1%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_79_How_to_prep_for_Amazon_UK_-_with_Greg_Jones.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=748-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_79_How_to_prep_for_Amazon_UK_-_with_Greg_Jones.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"_79_How_to_prep_for_Amazon_UK_-_with_Greg_Jones.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 32:44 &#8212; 30.0MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 32:44 &#8212; 30.0MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSGreg has sold on Amazon for about 2 \u00bd years now so he has quite a bit of experience with selling.
