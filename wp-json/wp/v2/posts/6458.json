After accusing China of reneging on past trade commitments, the US imposed new trade tariffs on a huge range of Chinese imports.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">About $250 billion worth of Chinese products will now face a 25% duty when imported into the USA.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">Previously, the majority of those products had been subject to a 10% import tax.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">That could lead to higher prices on a wide range of everyday products from electronics to clothing. While Trump claims Chinese companies will pay the price,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/trump-china-tariffs-may-slam-american-shoppers-with-800-in-costs-a-year-2019-5-1028187256\"><span class=\"s1\">research suggests<\/span><\/a> American businesses and consumers bear the brunt of tariffs.<\/p>\n<h2>Chinese Response to New Trade Tariff<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p6\">Officials at the Chinese Commerce Ministry \u2014 vowed on Wednesday to take &#8220;necessary countermeasures&#8221; against increased new trade tariff .<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">They also expressed optimism that the US could &#8220;meet China halfway,&#8221; the report said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">Those could include tariffs on American products or other trade barriers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">China has already placed retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of imports from the US, which had\u00a0caused significant trouble\u00a0for the US agricultural sector.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">The Chinese delegation said in a statement on Friday that it &#8220;deeply regrets&#8221; the US decision.<\/p>\n<h2>Are the New Tariffs Here to Stay?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p6\">The escalation comes just as officials were thought to be nearing a deal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">As recently as last week, there were high hopes for the two days of trade negotiations in Washington<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">While both countries have indicated a trade deal is still possible, questions have been raised about the timeline.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">While China might be forced to fold, experts agree that it would take more action from the US than already taken. Most likely, China will not change its approach and the US action is likely to stay permanent.<\/p>\n<h2>Future New Tariffs<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p6\">Trump on Monday also threatened to slap steep tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports, roughly $325 billion, a move that\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/trump-tariff-china-trade-war-consumer-goods-2018-9\"><span class=\"s1\">economists warn<\/span><\/a>\u00a0would have\u00a0widespread\u00a0effects on businesses and consumers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">&#8220;New tariffs on those goods that president has so far left untaxed will fall on American families, as these mostly hit textiles, apparel, shoes, home goods, etc.,&#8221; said Mary Lovely, a trade scholar at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">&#8220;Higher taxes on these goods are likely to be highly regressive, in that lower and middle class Americans spend a higher portion of their income on these Chinese imports than do higher income Americans,&#8221; she continued.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>What goods do the new trade tariffs cover?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The tariffs cover a wide array of goods, from minerals used in manufacturing, to vegetable juices, to leather handbags.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We have a downloadable list of the goods currently affected below.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new trade tariffs come as the US and China continue with their trade talks. Chinese Vice Premier \u2014 China&#8217;s top economic official \u2014 is in Washington to continue negotiations despite the new trade tariffs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The list of goods that will be subject to the increased tariffs was released by the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer&#8217;s office in September, when the 10% rate went into effect.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The final list is notably different from the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/trump-china-tariff-full-list-of-goods-products-2018-6\"><span class=\"s1\">first round of tariffs<\/span><\/a> on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, because there are consumer products on the list.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">The previous round focused\u00a0almost exclusively on industrial equipment\u00a0and machinery, while the new round includes items like hats, TVs, and food.<\/p>\n<h2>Consumer Goods Removed from the New Tariffs<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">There were 297 items removed from the <a href=\"https:\/\/ustr.gov\/\"><span class=\"s1\">USTR<\/span><\/a> (United States Trade Representative)\u00a0 initial list, released in July, after the public comment period<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Those include:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\">Certain consumer electronics including smartwatches<\/li>\n<li class=\"li6\">Some industrial chemicals used for manufacturing textiles<\/li>\n<li class=\"li6\">A few health and safety products including bicycle helmets<\/li>\n<li class=\"li6\">Specific kinds of child safety furniture like high chairs and car seats<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p6\">The USTR did not specify how it determined which products to remove beyond assertions that the official followed an inter-agency procedure and listened to feedback from businesses.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/trump-trade-tariffs-apple-products-cloud-industry-2018-9?r=UK&amp;IR=T\"><span class=\"s1\">smartwatch removal drew interest<\/span><\/a>\u00a0after it was revealed that Apple, makers of the Apple Watch,\u00a0directly lobbied the White House.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even with the removals, 5,745 full or partial tariff lines are included on the final list of the new trade tariffs that represent roughly $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.<\/p>\n<h2>Major categories of e-commerce goods included in the new trade tariffs:<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the major categories included in the list relevant to most e-commerce sellers:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><b>Essential oils<\/b>, perfumes:perfume;
