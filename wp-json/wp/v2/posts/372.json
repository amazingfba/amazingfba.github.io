In\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/34\"><span class=\"s3\">Episode 34<\/span><\/a>, he discusses tactics. But in this half of the interview, he discusses some big picture strategies with huge implications. Required listening for the ambitious Amazon Entrepreneur!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>SHOW NOTES FOR EPISODE #35<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>Product strategies:\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>commoditized light<\/b>\u00a0vs. differentiated heavy\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Many people are using the same Criteria for product selection, \u00a0e.g., light, small, can be air freighted, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The problem is that if everyone uses the same product criteria, you end up with huge competition. \u00a0Yes, they\u2019re easy products to start with, but the space ends up crowded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There is\u00a0\u00a0nothing wrong with\u00a0<b><i>starting<\/i><\/b>\u00a0with RA (retail Arbitrage)\u00a0\u00a0or commoditized products &#8211; it\u2019s a great way to learn about importing, working with Chinese suppliers, creating a product listing, PPC (Pay Per Click) advertising etc. \u00a0It just doesn\u2019t seem like a long term business to Peter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If for example you choose large, heavy products, you have to use ocean shipping, which means there<\/span><strong><span class=\"s4\"> currently<\/span><\/strong><span class=\"s1\"> is a lot less competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019ll order need to place a larger order to make the logistics make sense. \u00a0So there is more capital needed upfront and it is tied up for longer sitting on the ocean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These are problems to solve but they are also barriers to entry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0\u00a0<b>Your own design\u00a0<\/b>is the next step as an even bigger barrier to entry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In retail Arbitrage, you\u2019re competing for the buy box with the exact same product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">With private labelling, at least you are not competing for the buy box. But If the supplier designs the product, you are competing for ranking with essentially <strong>a commoditised product<\/strong><\/span><strong><span class=\"s4\"> that others can sell<\/span><\/strong><span class=\"s1\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Your design will protect you more from the competition if it is harder to copy. For example, a longer or thicker yoga mat is not a very hard difference to copy. \u00a0Often this depends on the amount of money you have or are prepared to invest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you need for example to use a designer, <\/span><span class=\"s4\">get<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> regulat<\/span><span class=\"s4\">ory<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> compliance<\/span><span class=\"s4\"> checks done<\/span><span class=\"s1\">, <\/span><span class=\"s4\">use lawyers and legal <\/span><span class=\"s1\">contracts with manufacturer, the supplier needs to make a new mould\u2026this all adds to the <\/span><span class=\"s4\">cost and <\/span><span class=\"s1\">complexity and makes it harder to duplicate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This then becomes more about how to minimize your upfront risk. Say if you create 8 new products, how can you set things up such that you only need 4 to succeed to break even, rather than say 5?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There was a famous example of a company called \u201cQuirky\u201d which went out of business recently. \u00a0They spent $<\/span><span class=\"s4\">4<\/span><span class=\"s1\">00,000 (\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s5\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/4\/24\/8488531\/quirky-invention-powered-by-quirky\"><span class=\"s6\">http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/4\/24\/8488531\/quirky-invention-powered-by-quirky<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s4\">) <\/span><span class=\"s1\">designing a blue tooth speaker &#8211; and then sold 30 units!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Trademarking and Patent protection can be complex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">But Trademarking is much easier, faster and cheaper than patents. It might be that you can <\/span><span class=\"s4\">get a U.S. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">trademark something for a few hundred dollars. Worth checking with a company like\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.legalzoom.com\/business\/intellectual-property\/trademark-registration-overview.html\"><span class=\"s3\">Legal Zoom<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How to minimize your risk\/reduce costs<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Think about reducing supply chain costs:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0\u00a0<b>Logistics:<\/b>\u00a0 use ocean shipping to improve your price competitiveness (or have more margin to put into advertising).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">How can you fill a container to make the max use of the space?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Can you spend $200 to have the pallets of goods delivered from US port to an Amazon warehouse in California rather than $hundreds to go across the US?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Reducing supply chain costs by removing a step:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s7\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexport.com\/\"><b>Flexport<\/b><\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u00a0<\/b>recently explained to Peter there are two options:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Option 1<\/b>: Have freight forwarder take freight all the way to a specific Amazon warehouse (so set up on Seller Central BEFORE setting up freight from CHina) or<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Option 2<\/b>: Freight Forwarder will usually have own warehouse, so get it sent there rather than FBA Inspection etc. then on to the various Amazon Warehouses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Ocean shipping:\u00a0<\/b>If Amazon asks you to send products to say 3 different USA warehouses, if you set that up before finalising your freight\/shipping, you can get your supplier to break it into the right number of pre-packed\u00a0<b>pallets<\/b>. This means your consignment won\u2019t need reworking inthe USA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This saves a step\/time but also reduces costs: <strong>Your supplier is likely to do<\/strong><\/span><strong><span class=\"s4\"> this at no\/low cost.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Order quantity:\u00a0<\/b>Order large enough quantities to get a reduced price per unit and economies of scale in the supply chain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Packaging &#8211;\u00a0<\/b>can you reduce the costs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>China Suppliers competing with you on Amazon:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There are <\/span><strong><span class=\"s4\">manufacturers<\/span><\/strong><span class=\"s1\"> already selling on Amazon. That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that most of them don\u2019t always want to commit a lot of money and energy to it because they are used to getting paid upfront; on Amazon, they have to wait a longer time for their money! Also, they are not usually so good at listing copy and photos, custom service and the other marketing functions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">HOWEVER there are <\/span><span class=\"s4\">a lot of <\/span><span class=\"s1\">domestic China\u00a0<b>Private Label Sellers<\/b>\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s4\">(not manufacturers) <\/span><span class=\"s1\">selling from China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Peter has talked to them and they say their disadvantage is that they don\u2019t understand consumer needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">BUT they are very good at commoditized products e.g. Power Banks for mobile\/cell phones. So be wary of commoditized products!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Some are creating their own brands and competing on price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You advantage is understanding your local (national) consumers better, so you know what product changes are needed. To the extent you can take advantage of that, you have an advantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Knowing your own customers helps greatly with product selection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Also you have native speaker language skills, knowledge of good product listings, photography etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>Differentiating your\u00a0\u00a0products:\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Basically you may need to make <\/span><span class=\"s4\">some kind of<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> upfront investment to really differentiate your product<\/span><strong><span class=\"s4\"> (time and\/or money)<\/span><\/strong><span class=\"s1\">. Then the key becomes mitigating risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Here\u2019s a possible strategy:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>1.\u00a0<\/b>Crowdfunding- get a design then post it up in\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/learn\"><span class=\"s3\">Kickstarter<\/span><\/a><\/span>\u00a0or\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiegogo.com\/\"><span class=\"s3\">Indiegogo<\/span><\/a><\/span>. This validates the idea and you can get the money upfront for an initial production run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">2. Make sales on Amazon to prove product acceptance, margins, sales volume and customer response (reviews)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s8\">3. Sell to brick and mortar retailers<\/span><span class=\"s1\">, <strong>leveraging feedback from Amazon volume, revenues and reviews to convince the retailer it\u2019s a great product<\/strong><\/span><strong><span class=\"s8\">.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Retailers will also need to know you can replenish inventory within say two weeks. So you would need local warehousing (as your supplier would probably need about<strong> 3 months<\/strong> to manufacture and deliver a new consignment of product<\/span><strong><span class=\"s4\"> if you are shipping by ocean<\/span><\/strong><span class=\"s1\">).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Parting words:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t let setbacks hold you back.
