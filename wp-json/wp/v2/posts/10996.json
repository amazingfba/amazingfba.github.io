Sure, the trajectory of doubling your sales month over month has changed. However, buyers are still looking to grow the businesses that they buy. This means that having great products with great reviews is very important when calculating the value of your business. Not only will Amazon continue to serve the products prominently in the search rankings, the buyer has a degree of comfort that they are buying quality products and that they\u2019ll be able to continue the businesses success.<\/li>\n<li><b>Clean Financials and Customer Metrics<\/b>. Like most small businesses, you likely don\u2019t have audited financial statements. However, it is important to track your financials and have clean tax returns to prove the profitability of the business. You\u2019ll also want to have documentation to prove your product manufacturing costs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition to helping the buyer get comfortable with the claims you make about the businesses profitability, having clean tax returns means that the business may also be eligible for an SBA acquisition loan. This will push the valuation higher and get you a higher percentage of the purchase price paid at close.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Reasonable Valuations<\/b>. Unlike the world of silicon valley, ecommerce businesses trade for a multiple of their annual profit. Depending on the size of your business, industry, track record and a litany of other factors, your business could be worth anywhere from 2.5 &#8211; 6 X annual profit. To get a more in-depth valuation of your business, you can request a valuation through an <a href=\"https:\/\/upwardexits.com\/amazon-business-valuation-calculator\/\">Amazon FBA valuation calculator<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Amazon scaling and automation tips<\/h2>\n<p>If you have been in the Amazon selling community for some time, then you have no doubt been introduced to a number of FBA selling coaches and courses. Tapping into the knowledge of a good coach or consultant such as <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/\">Amazing FBA<\/a> will make your life much easier both when it comes to scaling your business and automating it. Some tips that they may encourage you to do are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Use a third party seller dashboard<\/b>. Although Amazon is worth more than a trillion dollars now, they seem to invest very little time or money into making seller central easier for their merchants. Utilizing a third party dashboard will not only save you time with your operations, it makes the business more clear and digestible for potential buyers.<\/li>\n<li><b>Trim the fat<\/b>. Most entrepreneurs in Ecommerce are familiar with Tim Ferriss\u2019 book \u201cThe Four Hour Work Week\u201d and the \u201cPareto principal\u201d or \u201c80\/20 rule.\u201d In short, serious Amazon FBA Business Buyers are after the 20% of products that drive 80% of the profit. They have no interest in buying a catalog of 1,000 products that you resale.<\/li>\n<li><b>Hire and automate<\/b>. Instead of spending 5 hours\/month optimizing your listings yourself and tweaking your PPC bids, hire it out to a capable firm or freelancer. Even though this will likely decrease your profit by a few thousand dollars per month, you\u2019ll make that money back five times over by being much more appealing to buyers as a passively run business.<\/li>\n<li><b>Find competent representation<\/b>. You can surely try to sell your business yourself, however you\u2019re unlikely to understand the ropes the way an <a href=\"https:\/\/upwardexits.com\">online business broker<\/a> does. Finding the right buyer(s), understanding asset vs. stock sales, negotiating holdbacks and working capital adjustments, getting the deal financed, utilizing escrow services and migrating the account is a bit more complicated in practice than it may sound.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>About the author:<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"11021\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/preparing-your-amazon-fba-business-for-sale\/mark-woodbury-square\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mark-Woodbury-square.png?fit=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Mark Woodbury-square\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mark-Woodbury-square.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mark-Woodbury-square.png?fit=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-11021 alignleft\" style=\"width: auto !important; src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mark-Woodbury-square.png?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mark-Woodbury-square.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mark-Woodbury-square.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mark-Woodbury-square.png?resize=65%2C65&amp;ssl=1 65w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mark-Woodbury-square.png?resize=220%2C220&amp;ssl=1 220w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mark-Woodbury-square.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>Mark Woodbury is a serial entrepreneur and CEO of Upward Exits, a sell-side representative for digital business owners including content sites, ecommerce, Amazon FBA and SaaS businesses whose assets are valued over $1M.
