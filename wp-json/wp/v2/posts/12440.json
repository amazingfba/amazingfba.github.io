I&#8217;ve been sitting on the side lines for 2 years researching what I can about the FBA business. I feel I understand the process now and am seriously considering jumping in and beginning the product research stage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">My dilemma is that I feel I may have waited too long to start. More and more posts are complaining of the increase in fees, rules, and competition. My worry is that I will find the next potato peeler or bike pump or whatever using the same software everyone else is using, thus only delaying the evitable competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Now I totally get there will always be new competition, but it seems the increase in the FBA business model is at an all-time high. And there&#8217;s more frustrated posts with how to even be visible in searches you have to run constant PPC now (not just during the initial launch anymore), thus leading to a lot more time and money to barely break even.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">I can&#8217;t be the only one who hasn&#8217;t started because of similar thoughts, or worse, currently going through the struggles mentioned.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The poster&#8217;s Questions<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you had never started FBA (but with the knowledge you currently have from doing FBA), would you start it today? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #333333;\">What knowledge do you wish you had when you first started? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #333333;\">What are the biggest pain points of FBA? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #333333;\">Finally, are you planning to continue with FBA for the foreseeable years, or are you planning on shifting your business model?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you are planning on staying, what are the keys to success in your opinion?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Thanks in advance!<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>My answers<\/h2>\n<h3>*If you had never started FBA (but with the knowledge you currently have from doing FBA), would you start it today? *<\/h3>\n<p>Yes&#8230;BUT I would do so in a more mindful way.<\/p>\n<p>First and foremost &#8211; I would only do it if I could find a customer type I really cared about; a problem I was obsessed with solving; and a product type that I was equally in love with. Half-hearted or half-arsed is a total waste of time in crowded, competitive markets. And rightly so, btw. Consumers don&#8217;t owe you a living and Amazon doesn&#8217;t owe you organic rankings. You need to be good or go home.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, it will take time to home in on your perfect customer, to deep dive into their issues; and to perfect a product for them. But if you aren&#8217;t really committed to all three, I would just not bother starting. Probably true for any business model ever in fact in any competitive space (read &#8211; MOST!) not just Amazon or PL.<\/p>\n<h4>Get enough capital<\/h4>\n<p>Secondly, I would only do so if I could capitalise it properly. In theory, you could start with a<br \/>\nfew $1000. And I certainly don&#8217;t advise you to spend all your money in one go. But if I couldn&#8217;t at least set aside\/budget at least $10,000+ PER PRODUCT LINE, preferably a lot more, I personally wouldn&#8217;t bother.<br \/>\nPeople will be frothing at the mouth at this so I want to clarify 1 or 2 key phrases\/words:<\/p>\n<p>NOTA BENE:<br \/>\n1. &#8220;I personally&#8221; &#8211; lots of people would do differently.<br \/>\nFine. Go ahead and good luck. I&#8217;m answering Russell&#8217;s question.<\/p>\n<p>2. &#8220;budget\/set aside&#8221; &#8211; I<br \/>\ndidn&#8217;t say &#8220;spend all at once&#8221;.<br \/>\nyou should work your way into spending<br \/>\nmore money on some product line once it&#8217;s got at the very least traction, at best lots of profits.<\/p>\n<p>However I truly think it&#8217;s tragic when I see sellers find a product that can really take off profitably but they can&#8217;t fund the expansion. Yes organic expansion is a thing &#8211; but let&#8217;s say you grow sales organically 200% a year &#8230;from<br \/>\n$20K a year&#8230;it&#8217;s going to take YEARS to reach critical mass. Meanwhile your competition is funding it properly&#8230;do the math, as you say in the States.<\/p>\n<h3>*What knowledge do you wish you had when you first started?*<\/h3>\n<p>How long have you got? The above points most importantly.<br \/>\nAlso &#8211;<br \/>\nproper training in importing from China<br \/>\n&#8211; a partner who cared about product dev<br \/>\n&#8211; a peer group of people who knew what they were talking about<br \/>\n&#8211; a coach who had walked the path but was affordable<br \/>\n(sounds self serving but it happens to be true anyway)<br \/>\n&#8211; above all, the stones to follow what I cared about not a narrow business model<\/p>\n<h3>*What are the biggest pain points of FBA?*<\/h3>\n<p>FBA includes about 20 business models.<br \/>\nAssuming you&#8217;re talking very specifically about private label (and since<br \/>\nthat&#8217;s in the title of this group, I assume you are)&#8230;<br \/>\nthere are many but in summary<br \/>\n&#8211; Amazon account and listing suspensions<br \/>\n&#8211; Amazon seller support and in general Amazon&#8217;s relationship to sellers (we are ultra disposable &#8211; get over that or don&#8217;t go in)<br \/>\n&#8211; the deep capital requirement (if PL) to start a product line (not true for RA\/OA)<br \/>\n&#8211; the amount of cash (working capital) tied up for months esp if importing (again if PL)<br \/>\n&#8211; the amount of time (months) it takes to develop a customised product &#8211; even experienced\/competent people. This is usually VERY underplayed in the marketing.<br \/>\n&#8211; the increasing of Amazon ads as a % of revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid I see the drivers only pushing this gradually up over time. Plan accordingly. If you ask what that means, you could write a book but broadly, you&#8217;ll need fatter profit margins with all that implies.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; the increasing levels of competition.<\/p>\n<p>Competition heating up is far from unique to Amazon &#8211; in fact, it&#8217;s usually true for any successful market by definition &#8211; high profit levels, resulting from low competition, attract competitors. The land grab is over. It&#8217;s time for committed and well-capitalised companies and entrepreneurs, I&#8217;m afraid.<\/p>\n<h3>*Finally, are you planning to continue with FBA for the foreseeable years, or are you planning on shifting your business model?*<\/h3>\n<p>Yes and no. Yes in that I plan to keep being part of partnerships that sell custom products on amazon. No I<br \/>\nthe sense of doing it all myself. I love marketing and deep diving in understanding consumers. But I find product dev painful. I&#8217;m partnering with<br \/>\npassionate and very expert people in the latter these days. If you&#8217;re just starting out, there&#8217;s no reason such people will approach you sadly. Depends on who you are and who you know. I&#8217;ve personally<br \/>\nhad to earn such people&#8217;s trust over years in the space (coming up on 8 years)<\/p>\n<h3>* If you are planning on staying, what are the keys to success in your opinion?*<\/h3>\n<p>See above. My first answers plus expert partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>In summary &#8211; this stuff IS worthwhile and CAN be very big wins. But if you&#8217;re under-committed, under-capitalised just walk away.<br \/>\nThe most likely successes are the opposite;<br \/>\n&#8211; highly committed,<br \/>\n&#8211; well capitalised (hint &#8211; look at the size of the market you&#8217;re going into. If you can&#8217;t afford to outsell the current #1 seller, you&#8217;re probably not adequately capitalised. Again, I could write a book on this so it&#8217;s hard to summarise in a sentence)<br \/>\n&#8211; well connected if possible<br \/>\nThis is not obligatory but very helpful. Having an industry expert up your sleeve can be the key advantage needed.<\/p>\n<h3>Summary<\/h3>\n<p>Sorry if this is all tougher than you wanted to hear. I know many many people personally who have become legit millionaires from this (as in worth over $1M NET worth not just their home etc etc). But IF you&#8217;re talking PL\/custom products (as distinct from RA\/OA), it&#8217;s a real business these days, not a little side hustle.<\/p>\n<p>Go in with deep commitment, deep pockets and knowing some helpful people or stay home is my honest best summary advice.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re hesitating to start FBA at all, honestly, the best thing is to start with low risk and do Retail arb or online arb. Standing on the sidelines for 2 years isn&#8217;t going to serve you at all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2FShould_I_start_a_private_label_business_MICHAEL_EDIT-auphonic.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2Fis-fba-worth-it%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/Should_I_start_a_private_label_business_MICHAEL_EDIT-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=12440-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/Should_I_start_a_private_label_business_MICHAEL_EDIT-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"Should_I_start_a_private_label_business_MICHAEL_EDIT-auphonic.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 25:52 &#8212; 23.7MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 25:52 &#8212; 23.7MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSS\u201cShould I start an FBA business?\u201d Question If you have\/had an Amazon business, I really need your HONEST opinion.
