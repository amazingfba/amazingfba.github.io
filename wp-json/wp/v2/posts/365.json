So that\u2019s probably the main criterion for rejecting or accepting a batch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This is another reason for not beating the supplier down too high on price!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Ocean Shipping<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you recommend shipping insurance?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Like all insurance, it\u2019s easy to get cover but it\u2019s hard to get a payout if needed!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The actual probability of <\/span><span class=\"s3\">a loss<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> is mathematically low. It comes down to risk tolerance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you can afford to lose the money, it\u2019s <\/span><span class=\"s3\">may not be necessary<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. If it would bankrupt the company, that\u2019s when to get insurance!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is the cost difference between ocean and air freight?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There was a recent study on a product that was medium small sized, and they calculated a cost per unit of $6 by air and about $1 by ocean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There are fixed port costs either end. A <\/span><span class=\"s3\">very <\/span><span class=\"s1\">broad rule of thumb is that above 150 kg or 3 cubic metres, sea shipping makes more sense. Also very bulky items need to go by sea (because of volumetric weight)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Customs clearance<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you handle customs clearance at a US port?\u00a0(also: What is the cost of customs clearance for sea shipping?\u00a0How do you select a customs clearance agent for SS?)<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s10\">Answer to all of these: let your freight forwarder handle it! Peter has <\/span><span class=\"s1\">talked to the folks at<\/span><span class=\"s10\">\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexport.com\/\"><span class=\"s11\"><b>Flexport\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/a>(based in the USA)<\/span><span class=\"s1\">, but the industry is fragmented and there are many, many freight forwarders<\/span><span class=\"s10\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Freight Forwarder will ask :<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s12\">1.<\/span><span class=\"s13\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span class=\"s12\">Do you want<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>a. EXW (Ex works)<\/b>\u00a0(pick up straight from factory gates?) or\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">b.\u00a0<b>FOB (Free On Board)\u00a0<\/b>(the supplier will get the products on board ship then the Freight Forwarder takes over)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">2.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Where do you want it delivered to<\/span><span class=\"s3\">?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">3.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">What are the dimensions and weight of the product?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">They\u2019ll handle port fees and inland freight fees. And they may or my not include duty in the quote\u00a0but if not included in quote, and they will bill you for it. \u00a0When Sea shipping, always use a freight forwarder!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you need a freight forwarder for air freight?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Be clear about the difference between Air Freight or Air Courier service.<\/span><span class=\"s3\">\u00a0 Here is a good article: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thesourcingblog.com\/air-freight-from-china-explained\/\"><span class=\"s4\">http:\/\/www.thesourcingblog.com\/air-freight-from-china-explained\/<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The latter is eg DHL, Fedex, UPS. [You may get away without a freight forwarder for this. I have several times. But it\u2019s not foolproof- I also got burnt once! &#8211; Michael]<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For air freight proper, you probably need a freight forwarder. \u00a0If in doubt &#8211; ask a freight forwarder if you need to use them!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you need a separate customs broker?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Freight Forwarder will usually either have that in-house or have a relationship with one. So basically they take care of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>When making initial contact with Chinese suppliers, should I act as if [I am] the buyer and\u00a0have to OK prices with my boss?<\/b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter doesn\u2019t recommend starting a relationship with \u201cuntruths\u201d! Mostly the reason for this is for\u00a0price negotiations. That leads back to price vs. quality trade off (plus the time and aggravation spent on negotiating for small price differences)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you do want to negotiate on price,<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> you can<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> focus on getting multiple quotes and then compare.\u00a0(Traditional retailers also figure out the costs of materials and labour and add on margin for the\u00a0supplier<\/span><span class=\"s3\">,<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> but this is more complex)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Is it true that Chinese factories generally give you a price that is close to the cost of\u00a0production?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It can be. Chinese factories <\/span><span class=\"s3\">often<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> get their profit margin from the VAT rebate of say 9-17%. \u00a0If you are getting a good quote, the price can be close to cost &#8211; depends on how good your price is!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Any advice on Sourcing from US, UK and European Manufacturers?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This is not something that Global Sources focusses on although the issues may be mostly the\u00a0same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Is using a gmail address OK for contacting suppliers? (because of\u00a0spam from would-be suppliers)<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Suppliers are also getting more sophisticated &#8211; they will often look up you and your company in eg\u00a0Linked-In. Good suppliers are capacity constrained. The new suppliers and ones that will work with\u00a0anybody <\/span><span class=\"s3\">may not<\/span> <span class=\"s3\">be <\/span><span class=\"s1\">the ones you want<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> to work with<\/span><span class=\"s1\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">To convince the good suppliers to work with you, you want to come across as well as possible\u00a0(although some of the buyers from the larger retailers do use Gmail to avoid spam).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Try to have a company domain, a company website.
