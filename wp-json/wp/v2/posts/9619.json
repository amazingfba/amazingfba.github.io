They work with a lot of \u201cbootstrappers\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Most clients have a business around for 2-3 years or more.<\/p>\n<p>At the moment, one business around 25 years (ancient for internet business!).<\/p>\n<h4><b>Business sales<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>About $75M in<b><i> enterprise value<\/i><\/b> in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, expecting $100M.<\/p>\n<p>Last year,\u00a0 80% of Transactions were E-commerce businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Around 55% of those were based around Amazon:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; 46% was strictly Amazon<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>10% mixed platform &#8211; including Amazon<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A lot of businesses have an off Amazon element. But to qualify as a \u201cmixed platform\u201d business, it needs to have about a 50\/50 split between on- and off-Amazon revenue.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Mark Daoust\u2019s\u00a0 Background<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Been doing online stuff for going on 20 years.<\/p>\n<p>15 years ago had a content website. He was newly married.<\/p>\n<p>Thought it would be fun to sell this. Hired an advisor (broker) and was very unimpressed.<\/p>\n<p>Marked looked at the broker\u2019s work and thought, \u201cHe gets 10% off the sale value &#8211; how hard could it really be?\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This presented itself. Mark sold the business.<\/p>\n<p>Mark worked in some fledgling businesses for a year &#8211; a good friend decided to sell a company. He knew Mark would help him with it. Mark did indeed get the business sold.<\/p>\n<p>The first 2 years was about honing processes two achieve two main aims:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making the transactions safe and secure in the M &amp; A industry.<\/li>\n<li>How to really prepare a business for sale.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><b>How Mark felt like a business seller<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>There were the usual exclusive contract and long agreement.<\/p>\n<p>But the broker didn\u2019t seem to do much!<\/p>\n<p>For the business brokerage, the industry norm is that the value is in the number of contracts you sign, a certain percentage of those work, and that is how the brokerage makes money.<\/p>\n<p>Mark felt that the broker and seller interests were not aligned.<\/p>\n<p>Mark wanted to help business owners understand what drove the value.<\/p>\n<p>It makes the decision making cleaner.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Mark\u2019s experience selling his business<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Mark was just given a number for the value of $350K.<\/p>\n<p>Then the 1st offer was junk $75K.<\/p>\n<p>The second offer eventually went ahead at a slightly higher valuation, but still, way lower than Mark had been lead to expect.<\/p>\n<p>The aim is to be a real advisor &#8211; what is the value of the asset I\u2019m holding?<\/p>\n<p>Should I sell or hold? It\u2019s a critical decision and you don\u2019t get two chances.<\/p>\n<p>So you want to be well informed as a business seller.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Why bother selling a business if it\u2019s a successful one?\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Mark suggests you <i>shouldn\u2019t <\/i>aim to sell a good business if\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It generates cash flow<\/li>\n<li>Not too much time<\/li>\n<li>Happy to do it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s usually harder to create a new business than you think. Partly because luck comes in, so in this case, do not put your Amazon FBA Business up for sale.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Creating twin values<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>You have 2 values in <a href=\"https:\/\/yourlifestylebusiness.com\/amazon-fba\/\">building<\/a> your business<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cashflow (like stock dividend)<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019re creating an asset (like the value of the stock) in your overall portfolio<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There does come a point in time when selling makes sense. That\u2019s when you realize the asset value.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Why sell?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Especially with the physical product business, most of the value you\u2019ll get is when you sell.<\/p>\n<p>The economics of e-commerce business -or even SaaS &#8211; is such that you have to reinvest most cash.<\/p>\n<h4><b>The right time to sell a business<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>There comes an inflection point in your life.<\/p>\n<p>Eg: A client acquired a business 5 years before for $30-40K<\/p>\n<p>It grew to about 400-500K per year in Profits (about $2M revenue)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not continue to sell the business?\u201d Asked Mark<\/p>\n<p>On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I keep the inventory in the second garage.<\/p>\n<p>To grow this, we would have to get an office, staff, etc.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Other life inflexions<\/b><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting married<\/li>\n<li>Spend a year with a new child<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><b>Usually selling for the money alone is not a great<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><b>You can turn a corner<\/b><\/p>\n<p>You can create a business that would cashflow your lifestyle but you need a pretty serious EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation, and Amortisation &#8211; broadly, pre-tax profit]- say around 1.5M USD<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have the ambition to grow a 10-20M revenue business, that can be another reason to put Amazon FBA Business up for sale.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Is my business even sellable?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Amazon businesses are generally quite sellable.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Put yourself in the buyer\u2019s shoes<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Why are they buying your business?<\/p>\n<p>They want an ROI &#8211; they want not only a return of their capital, but they also want to get a positive return on it.<\/p>\n<h4><b>What are the elements that make my business sellable?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The main elements are age; revenue and sales; and defensibility.<\/p>\n<p><b>Age<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Firstly, the older the business, the better. It\u2019s rare to be able to sell a business younger than 12 months.<\/p>\n<p>Typically buyers want to see more sustainable business. Age is great proof of that.<\/p>\n<p>5 years shows a lot of sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>8 years is really impressive.<\/p>\n<p><b>Market adoption\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Revenue<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It needs to be a decent revenue number<\/p>\n<p><b>Earnings<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Two perspectives:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buyer perspective &#8211; earnings implies ROI is good.<\/li>\n<li>Adaptability is good &#8211; if you have products in high demand<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4><b>Amazon-specific business issues<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The ubiquitous nature of the marketplace can mean that the differentiation factors became price and ratings.<\/p>\n<p>There then tends to be a hierarchy of value\/sellability of Amazon businesses based on the defensibility\/differentiation factors.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Brand protection\/defense<\/b><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Brand registry<\/li>\n<li>The uniqueness of your product<\/li>\n<li>Patents, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><b>Dropshipping<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>If you were a drop-shipper on Amazon, there is no restriction to anyone else &#8211; they just aren\u2019t very valuable.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Drop-shipping business failure story\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>There was a business dropshipping a not very distinct product.<\/p>\n<p>The revenue gains in triple-digit gains annually.<\/p>\n<p>Then it got visible enough to appear on business intelligence software.<\/p>\n<p>The revenues took a slaughtering.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Contracts with existing brands<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Contracts with existing brands CAN be valuable.

You have 48 hours to remove the logo and product from the site.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This put the value of the business in question.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, going through the practice of planning had lead to putting a backup vendor in place.<\/p>\n<p>They bought an extra month\u2019s time, the backup vendor became the main vendor and the sale went ahead.<\/p>\n<p>That would never have happened without preparing thoroughly for sale in all aspects.
