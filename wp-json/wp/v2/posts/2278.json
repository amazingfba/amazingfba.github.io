It is all about how to outsource Amazon tasks. Nathan shares with us his story of going from a broke college student to Amazon drop shipper, to creating <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/freeeup\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FreeeUp<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He did it all with an attitude of strategic trial and error. He explains why it\u2019s important to know whether you are hiring somebody to do something you do know how to do but is repetitive, or hiring somebody for something you don\u2019t know how to do and that isn\u2019t worth your time to learn. The first person to hire in Nathan\u2019s business model is an outside expert to help you move forward. Then start with outsourcing to one assistant at a time. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Nathan\u2019s Story<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan was a college student looking for extra beer money when he started buying and selling textbooks. He felt that the bookstore was ripping everyone off. Soon enough he had lines out the door of people selling their textbooks to him. That soon led him to Amazon because, as he says, \u201cyou don\u2019t sell books for very long without learning about Amazon.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking books were soon going to be a thing of the past, Nathan began experimenting with other products and drop shipping. He ended up running a million dollar business out of his college dorm room. He hired friends, making good and bad business decisions and learning along the way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Nathan graduated, he did his Amazon business full time and it was growing and doing very well. But he realised he was spending too much time on HR activities. He was using UpWork at the time and had a great remote team, but wanted a more efficient way to hire, and so <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/freeeup\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FreeeUp<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was born. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>FreeeUP &#8211; Outsource Amazon Tasks<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/freeeup\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FreeeUp<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is different from other outsourcing platforms because it isn\u2019t a job board where you have to post the job and then sift through all the applicants. Instead, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/freeeup\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FreeeUp<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does the vetting for you and they introduce you to one worker they have pre-vetted who meets your requirements. They only let in the top 1% into their network so you get that experience of being able to hire top talent quickly, which is so important as a business owner.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Getting Started and Outsource Amazon Tasks<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan recommends starting with outsourcing pretty early, but waiting until you have some sort of revenue stream. If you\u2019re still in the idea phase, don\u2019t hire yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He does believe in bootstrapping at the start\u2014he even wrote a book on bootstrapping called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1545459134\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=roth09-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1545459134&amp;linkId=180575528c24ca2865c958cd967fdcac\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free Up Your Business: 50 secrets to bootstrap million dollar companies<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014but advises once you start having a little bit of revenue you should start investing it back into the company. The best way to do that is with good people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two main ways to do that. Either hire someone to take something off your plate or hire an expert to do something that you don\u2019t know how to do. If you have tasks that you do repeatedly and you have systems and processes in place, and your time isn\u2019t focused on the right thing, because you\u2019re doing these tasks instead of focusing on the company, then you should hire lower-level workers and put them in place to free up your time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are approaching something that you don\u2019t know how to do (e.g. marketing or creating a video) then you should hire the mid-level or expert-level workers. They are more expensive but you don\u2019t have to train them and there\u2019s an opportunity cost if you learn how to do it yourself because it usually isn\u2019t worth your time as a business owner. The best business owners have a hybrid of both.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_129\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=129\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h2><b>Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Invest in Your Business<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people are too obsessed with trying to find the cheapest way to do stuff and are very afraid of spending money. The problem is that they are not taking the opportunity cost of that attitude seriously enough. Cheap becomes expensive. Trying to save money in the short term can cost a lot in the long term, especially if you pay somebody too little, invest a lot of time training them up, and then they leave for a higher paying job elsewhere. They take that time and training with them and you have to start all over again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of times people are scared also of the trial and error approach. Know that you will put money into a lot of different things. Some won\u2019t work out but some will be very successful. If you have a very small budget and are afraid to put any money into anything, there\u2019s no way you will succeed or move forward. Be quick to fire people and replace them if they\u2019re not doing a good job, but get new people into the team to see what goes well. Not everything you try will be a winner so spread your risk. Cut the losses and follow up hard on the things that work. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Nathan\u2019s Approach to Outsource Amazon Tasks<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first 6-12 months of running a business, Nathan does the majority of the work putting his own hours in. You don\u2019t have to outsource the work. However, you can hire an expert to do a 1 \u2013 2 hour audit or be an on-call consultant. They can keep you on track and save you thousands for perhaps $50 per hour of their time. Or you might be able to get a mentor to do it and that won\u2019t necessarily cost you money. Mentoring or consulting with an expert can save you months of wasted time and a ton of wasted cash. It\u2019s a no-brainer as a business owner. Learning from other people\u2019s mistakes is quicker, cheaper and easier than making them yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Early Stages<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early stages, the only outsourcing he does is that expert consulting to keep him on track, or hiring a worker for any one-time stuff that comes up. The next step is to create a list of everything you do on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis and put it in order from easiest to hardest. If you\u2019re running an Amazon business, the easiest stuff is the customer service emails. If you\u2019re doing FBA, there might not even be that many. Other things include bookkeeping, creating listings and doing keyword research. As the business starts making money he will hire an assistant part time, and then full time, and then a second assistant to do those tasks. That\u2019s the approach he takes over time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many factors to outsourcing so it goes back into the trial and error approach. There is no one way to outsource Amazon tasks, but the key is to be strategic so that you minimize risk and give yourself opportunities to succeed when something does work out. Minimize the risk, maximize the possibilities and think like an investor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b><a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"2334\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/178-outsource-amazon-tasks-nathan-hirsch\/apple-606761_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?fit=640%2C425&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,425\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D300&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.005&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"apple-606761_640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?fit=640%2C425&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-2334 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640-300x199.jpg?resize=335%2C222\" alt=\"\" width=\"335\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?resize=65%2C43&amp;ssl=1 65w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?resize=220%2C146&amp;ssl=1 220w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?resize=151%2C100&amp;ssl=1 151w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?resize=358%2C238&amp;ssl=1 358w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?resize=602%2C400&amp;ssl=1 602w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/apple-606761_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>Standard Operating Procedures<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When to create the Standard Operating Procedures for your business will depend on the type of people you are hiring and the tasks you are getting them to do. If you\u2019re going for the cheapest of the cheap and hiring those $2 or $3 per hour workers who have no experience, then you need a Standard Operating System when you outsource Amazon tasks. Do not let them into your account without it. But if you hire someone with years of experience through <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/freeeup\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FreeeUp <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for say $7 per hour, you might not even need a SOP because they already know how to do it. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SOPs are very important. The problem with creating them in the early stage of the company is that they change so much. If you are creating the SOPs in month 6, within 3 months they\u2019re likely outdated. The time spent creating them is an opportunity cost for going out and getting clients at that early stage. As a new business owner, you\u2019ll be learning and changing your processes. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Wait to Write SOP<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan advises that you get smart people in, have basic procedures, and then figure the systems out with them. Have them provide their feedback, knowledge, and experience. THEN create the SOPs and hire people to follow them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing when to be flexible and when to get rigid with SOPs comes down to knowing what results you are getting. How many problems and issues are happening in the business without SOPs? Are the results inconsistent, or going down, or are the consistently going up? If it\u2019s inconsistent or at the same level, continue to improve. You see that it\u2019s continually working, then it\u2019s time to standardize it. If there are problems then you keep evolving and building on what you have. When you have gone a month without those issues, get it in writing as the fundamentals of a good Standard Operating Procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>More Information<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find out more about FreeeUp here: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/freeeup.com\/how-it-works\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/freeeup.com\/how-it-works\/<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or check out Nathan\u2019s book here: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/freeeup.com\/free-up-your-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/freeeup.com\/free-up-your-business\/<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Get $1\/hour off your first life, on your first hire by going to <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/freeeup\">amazingfba.com\/freeeup<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_129\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=129\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch How to outsource Amazon Tasks Part 1 of 4<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221;
