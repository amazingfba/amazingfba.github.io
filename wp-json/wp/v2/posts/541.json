Manuel has 11 years&#8217; experience of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalfromasia.com\/amazonbusinessinhongkong\/\">sourcing in Hong Kong and China<\/a> and also is an Amazon seller with several product lines live and selling well.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>EPISODE 51 SHOW NOTES<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What took you to Hong Kong? <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Went there for a 6 month internship<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>for an Austrian electronics firm in 2005. He was handling sourcing from suppliers. He fell in love with the city and a woman and never left!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He loved the drive and opportunities of Hong Kong. Very expensive but great place to live. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you also sell on Amazon? <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes since August 2014. Also documented launching a whole brand. He currently has\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">7 products and 10 more coming in the next few months. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s focussed on getting after 3-5 categories in different categories. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">He launched then stopped a few more. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">He has several businesses which were more of a priority till now. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What are they?<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sell.amazon.com\/sell.html\"><span class=\"s1\">Selling on amazon<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sourcing company in hong kong for amazon sellers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\">A consulting and import course, step by step guide to import from china and sell on amazon but also sell to retail.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>He started out with a consumer electronics brand, selling to retailers in Europe under own brand and their own brand, but also now on Amazon. Now Manuel is focussing on his own Amazon business as it is really picking up.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tell me about stopping a product?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He used to sell smart phone accessories but then the prices got so low there was not much profit. Electronics can be very competitive. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What\u2019s your process for selecting products? What are your selection criteria?\u00a0<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you go by the numbers of individual products? Or build a brand in a niche? <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manuel is more old fashioned, doesn\u2019t use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.junglescout.com\/\">Jungle Scout<\/a> or ASIN inspection so much. He subscribes to relevant product websites. newsletters, goes to trade shows. Also looks at Kickstarter and Indigogo for product concepts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manuel doesn\u2019t look into creating a huge brand in one category. Tries out one product in a niche e.g. coffee press. If that takes off, build into that niche. If not, don\u2019t go into say grinders, filters etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Coffee press now selling about 20 a day. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>beat the competition? <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You need to stand out to beat the competition.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Try not to copy the competition. This is his approach. Will Tjernlund does copy the competition, but Manuel is more interested in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/what-to-sell-on-amazon\">creating unique products<\/a> and building a brand. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How can we make a product unique in a simple way? <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Example 1:\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Blue tooth speaker<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The sample looked bad, plastic finish, bad sound, packaging horrible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The finish rubber instead of plastic was 20 cents more but immediately looked better. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Then looked at components, sound was bad, different driver sounded much better\u00a0and cost just\u00a050 cents more. \u00a0Used photographer to get b<\/span><span class=\"s1\">etter photos.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He turned a $10 \u00a0product into a $30 product but only cost him $2 more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Focus on finish, minor improvements etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Example 2 &#8211; Coffee Press<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are \u00a0lots of stainless steel finishes, but no copper finish. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">So Manuel had that done and added in extra filters etc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Look at the little things you can change. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Tell us about working with suppliers. What\u2019s the best way to approach your supplier about this?<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Introduce yourself including company presentation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Create an excel file or word doc about the product- include bullet points, this is where it\u2019s at, this is what i want instead.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Also point out that if you improve the product, they will make more sales with other customers as well. so they are more willing to make changes with costs. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>So you\u2019re not trying to get an exclusive deal with them? <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Amazon sellers are mostly a small part of a suppliers\u2019 business. if Manuel does say $10,000 a year he\u2019s a very small fish. that may be 0.5% of their turnover if you work with a big factory (this is true for his own coffee press. They also work with Tesco\u2019s who order $1m a year)<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you get an exclusive deal for amazon rights?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He has set up an agreement with the Purchase Order which says &#8211; \u201cMy plan is to order 10,000 units. Are you willing to give me exclusivity for a year. If I don\u2019t reach 5000 units within 6 months, we can cancel this agreement. \u201c<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This give Manuel 6 months to figure out if he wants to place more orders <\/span><span class=\"s1\">and it means the supplier can make more profit too after 6 months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manuel is okay with that because he would have a head start, maybe 100-200 reviews already. It&#8217;s okay to have competition. It\u2019s not all about one item only. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manuel is happy if he can do 6 months of excellent sales on one product. That repays the time and money invested already.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Greg Mercer was saying if you get 6 months\u2019 head start, you can defend your product against competition. So you agree with that?<\/b><\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, that does work. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Where do you go to look for suppliers for selling on Amazon?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Manuel has collected over 1000 business cards for suppliers from previous job being a product manager, when he went to China every 2 weeks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manuel also works with a lot of trading companies. He will sometimes be willing to pay say 50 cents more and use a trading company, similar to agent. Some of them work as if you are working with factory, for example if factory doesn\u2019t speak English, don\u2019t know about country requirements eg <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ce-marking.org\/what-is-ce-marking.html\">CE<\/a>\u00a0(European Union), <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/FCC_Declaration_of_Conformity\">FCC<\/a>\u00a0(USA), FDA (Food &amp; Drug Administration, USA) approval, doesn\u2019t have experience exporting to a country, etc., etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So working with a trading company can make a lot of sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Alibaba and Global Sources Manuel does use if he can\u2019t find anyone through his network &#8211; you can verify and vet the suppliers. You can still vet them by checking their certificates, asking who they work with,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Which markets they export to etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, If Manuel asks \u201cwhere do you export to?\u201d and they say, \u201cMiddle East\u201d and you want to export to USA, don\u2019t bother. He wants a supplier <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s also good to know a few names in the industry eg small supermarket or worked with an Amazon seller before. Check business certificate. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What are the big dos and don\u2019ts for selecting a supplier? Assuming Alibaba, Global Sources or HKTDC and someone who is new to the process. <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There is a lot of filtering you can do. e.g. a microwave on Alibaba, filter by Gold Supplier, trade assurance, 3rd party verification. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can also filter by region &#8211; say 10 different provinces of China. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s say Guangdong have 5000 suppliers and another has just 10. That shows you where the main factories are for this kind of product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If a region specialises in making those products, they have the resources and the infrastructure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Say in Jeijung province, with 10 supplier results, they probably don\u2019t specialise in that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are many other filters you can use. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Send out enquiries to 10 suppliers. 3 or 4 get back to Manuel with and answer all his to Qs<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Email out \u201cvendor profile\u201d, \u00a0asking for:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2 customer references for customers<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">markets. Has he exported to this country before?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">business certificates, and certificates for prods<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">no workers; when company established; annual turnover. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">do they do R &amp; D? Have their own engineers? how many product lines?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">You get a gut feeling after a while. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><em><span class=\"s1\">This is included in <\/span><span class=\"s2\">import dojo ebook <\/span><\/em><span class=\"s1\"><em>as a downloadable document.<\/em> <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/importdojo\">Import Dojo <\/a>is actually a 60-page book which is a bestseller on Amazon! It is free at the company&#8217;s site.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>What&#8217;s next in your process? <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Get a soft copy of any certificates needed &#8211; prove he has it! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">IF that\u2019s okay, then ask for a sample from at least 2-3 suppliers. Same process with all suppliers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>If all samples are equal, go with most responsive\/proactive and helpful supplier, even if price is a little higher. Then place an order.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>So you\u2019re okay with higher prices?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They need to make profit too, they work hard. The factory will be business partner, it should be a fair biz relationship. As long as profit is built into your price, it\u2019s fine to pay a little bit more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have individualised products and with good product price, you can afford<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re building a brand, if you squeeze in cheap products, it won\u2019t help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>I guess it depends on whether you have customised products vs. commoditised products sold en masse?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, I\u2019m building a brand, so selling cheap products to make a quick buck is not part of my strategy. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is the best tip for negotiating on product price once you have verified that the quoted price is in the fair region? Should simple customisations really cost that much more?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There shouldn\u2019t really be a big difference. Unless the supplier has to invest money into a new tool or a new mould. If it\u2019s just a colour difference, it shouldn\u2019t be much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To find if it\u2019s reasonable, ask at least 3 suppliers for a quote. IF one is way off on price, he\u2019s either incompetent or trying to rip you off!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To contact Manuel, <a href=\"http:\/\/importdojo.com\/contact\/\">click here <\/a>for the Import Dojo contact page.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b><\/b><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>NEXT EPISODE<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/53-china-sourcing-for-amazon-keep-money-safe-quality-control-and-freight-with-manuel-becvar-of-import-dojo-part-2-of-2\/\">Episode #53<\/a>, Manuel gives details on keeping your money safe, getting quality control for Electronic Products, simple ways to start with Freight, overall process and predictions for the future of Amazon.
