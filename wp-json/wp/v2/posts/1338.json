When asked what he was working on, Tor responded that he was working on the GCID program. It stands for the Global Catalog Identification system. This means that people can have a brand, and put their own brand on Amazon and have these account numbers linked to their brand. Brad says that this was the start of the whole brand revolution that has happened over the past three years. People have discovered that private labeling is much better than competing by the box. Instead of people competing over the same item using the pricing algorithm, many have moved to private label and own the ASIN. Now they get all the sales.<\/p>\n<p>This year, with all the fraud stuff going on, Amazon is figuring out brand protection and brand control, and those are big things coming from inside Amazon; trying to get more brand control and brand protection. Big brands, like Sony, was the originally intended beneficiary. These companies have a lot of products with fraudulent listings.\u00a0Then they realized they could extend it for a lot of people.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon has gotten more into brand gating, and brand content because of these sellers. This is likely going to be the beginning of a program that sellers love. Amazon will get that feedback and keep building more and more around your brand. This also builds consumer trust.<\/p>\n<h2>Consumer trust is a big thing lately. A lot of people have come out about getting defrauded by Chinese sellers not being forthright about the authenticity of their products. Now Amazon has a big PR battle to deal with.<\/h2>\n<p>That\u2019s a big issue. That\u2019s a major differentiator between them and eBay. eBay feels more like the wild west whereas Amazon was more in control with actual brands. So consumer trust is one of, if not the, biggest thing on Bezos\u2019 mind.<\/p>\n<p>When things like that come out, all the big heads come together and institute new programs to solve whatever problem.\u00a0Amazon is trying to solve the fraud issue with brand gate and brand control.<\/p>\n<h2>You said there were two things about where Amazon was heading. What was your second thought?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s not so much about where Amazon is heading, but rather the minds of the brand owners needs to be going in. You have a lot of these large brands that really understand brand management because they have been doing it for 50 or 100 years. Amazon has enabled these new sellers and they are powerful and effective at building their brand.<\/p>\n<p>The idea, for the last couple years, is that these people have gotten a certain part of the brand going and now they have to determine where to\u00a0go from here. Over the next couple years, you\u2019ll see more sophistication in the brands. Who the brand is, who identifies with it, what\u2019s the target audience.<\/p>\n<h2>You mentioned the Chinese sellers. Obviously, Amazon is courting them, and trying to create a link to them. They\u2019ve gone so far as to open offices in China. How can we, in America, the UK, or anywhere else in the world, compete with the Chinese sellers trying to sell direct on Amazon?<\/h2>\n<p>It comes down to what do you mean by compete. If you think about what the Chinese are good at that those in the UK aren\u2019t. They have manufacturing there with some very competitive costs. There are other manufacturers in the world that have better prices, but they\u2019re harder to reach because you can\u2019t look them up on Alibaba.<\/p>\n<p>The bigger question is, if these manufacturers can cut out the middlemen and sell direct to consumer, where does that leave these middlemen that are trying to create a brand? That\u2019s what the majority of these sellers are.<\/p>\n<p>Many of these manufactures don\u2019t have the acumen to be that middleman. They\u2019re not very good at it. The middleman is very valuable. They are doing the work to build a brand and they\u2019re doing the research on what\u2019s going to be a big seller. There is a place for sellers. Remember, just because these manufacturers can make the products cheap, middlemen are still needed to figure out what products need to be marketed.<\/p>\n<p>There is some worry about counterfeit. If a seller does all the research and comes up with a brand idea, and what if someone else takes the idea and sell their own. Brad spoke with some attorneys when he was in Hong Kong.\u00a0They said that you can actually set rules and regulations of your products with the manufacturer. That way they can\u2019t take your product and sell it to someone else. You can work within the Chinese system and shut down other manufacturers if they copy what you\u2019re doing.<\/p>\n<p>Just remember what they can do, what your can do, where the value lies, and how your brand can gain consumer trust. How often is a Chinese manufacturer gathering emails, and sending emails to their customers. That\u2019s a very western idea and way of thinking.<\/p>\n<p>You can email Brad at brad@productslab.net, or use the contact form on their website, productlabs.net.
