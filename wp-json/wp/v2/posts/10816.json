First of all is specific eCommerce risk. Selling products online, even through Amazon FBA,\u00a0 involves just as many potential dangers as selling them at a brick and mortar store. There are several unique risks of eCommerce relating to privacy, online security, and ownership and liability concerns. Others are common to any online business. As a result, it\u2019s vital to insure your eCommerce business against risks. Moreover,\u00a0 it\u2019s also a requirement for selling on Amazon FBA. Here are common examples of risks eCommerce businesses face.<\/p>\n<h3><b>eCommerce Risk 1: Cyber Attacks<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Cybercriminals often target eCommerce businesses. There has also been an increase in cyber attacks in recent years and one of the reasons is the <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/coronavirus-ecommerce\/\">effect of coronavirus on eCommerce<\/a>. No business is too small to be attacked. That&#8217;s why many small business owners make the mistake of not considering their business at risk of a data breach. A data breach could cause your business extended downtime resulting in losses, or worse yet customer privacy being jeopardised. Above all, this could end up in a lawsuit against your company. Therefore, it\u2019s important to ensure you protect your business against data breaches.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Risk 2: Privacy Issues<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s common knowledge in the business that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jeffbullas.com\/data-privacy-and-security\/\">data privacy and security are big risks for eCommerce<\/a>. Privacy laws state that eCommerce businesses need to be completely clear about what information they\u2019re taking from visitors to their site. Yes, it\u2019s standard to collect this data for analytical purposes. However,\u00a0 you need to ensure you follow the correct guidelines according to the law. Otherwise, you certainly could be liable for infringement or interference with privacy rights.<\/p>\n<h3><b>eCommerce Risk 3: <\/b><b>Intellectual property risks<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Your intellectual property is at risk if you don\u2019t get it protected. There are several risk areas. Firstly, this must include all aspects of your business. Furthermore, it must include products and branding, because other businesses could otherwise claim the rights to these. Here is the official <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/protecting-intellectual-property-rights-on-e-commerce-stores\/protecting-intellectual-property-rights-on-e-commerce-stores\">government guide to protecting intellectual property<\/a> for eCommerce. Secondly, you could also be at risk of intellectual property infringement as an eCommerce business. In addition, even if your business is legitimate, you need to be careful with third-party advertising. That&#8217;s because it could infringe on another company\u2019s intellectual property.<\/p>\n<h3><b>\u00a0Risk 4: <\/b><b>Product liability<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>As with any businesses that sell products to customers eCommerce businesses need <a href=\"https:\/\/withlayr.com\/blog\/education\/questions\/ecommerce-product-liability-insurance\/\">product liability insurance<\/a>. It\u2019s important to make sure you go with the right product liability insurance for your business. If an item you\u2019ve sold has defects or causes harm to a customer you need to be protected. Because you&#8217;re otherwise at risk of liability, make sure all the products you\u2019re selling also come with any necessary warnings and directions. Test your products as well to check for any possible flaws.<\/p>\n<h3><b>eCommerce Risk 5:<\/b><b>Professional liability<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>You need to ensure that you treat your customers fairly according to the conditions both of you agreed to. If you fail to deliver an item, for instance, be sure you compensate the customer fairly.\u00a0 This can be quite a complicated issue and you don\u2019t want customer complaints. You can find out more about your professional liability from <a href=\"https:\/\/insuranceoctopus.co.uk\/\">The Insurance Octopus<\/a>. You\u2019ll need to take out sufficient business insurance to trade as an eCommerce business. So make sure you are as informed as possible. This will be the best way to protect your company.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As with all businesses, running an eCommerce business is not without risk.
