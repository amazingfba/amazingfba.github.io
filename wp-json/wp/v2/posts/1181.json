This isn\u2019t so much about your mindset, but rather about understanding the mindset of the consumer. By that I mean a shopper that has the potential to buy from you. I feel like people don\u2019t truly understand this and therefore there is an opportunity for you on Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Triple M: Message to Market Match<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is key in driving sales and conversions. Let\u2019s unpack this in non-internet terms. This is a fundamental process that applies in any market in any medium whether it\u2019s face-to-face or online or wherever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I was in a room full of cat-owners and they hated dogs, I could offer them the best dog food in the world. I could say, \u201cit would make your dog leap for joy and it will make him\/her the happiest and healthiest dog and add five years to their lives. It is normally \u00a350 and I will sell it for \u00a33.\u201d How many responses would I get? Zero! Now, if I had a room full of dog owners, the response would be much different. Message to market match is crucial.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Applying the Concept to Amazon<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon does its best to ensure there is good message to market match because it leads to happier consumers. Happier consumers will like and trust Amazon more and keep coming back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that we are leveraging people\u2019s trust in Amazon. When someone does a search on Amazon they are saying, \u201cI am looking to buy xxxx.\u201d Amazon then looks at all the listings it has available. Then compares keywords that are in the title and the bullet points. Then determines whether those keywords have helped that product sell, and delivers the best matches to the consumer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are selling dog food, and the shopper puts in the word \u201ccat food\u201d, you have to hope that Amazon does not display your listing. If it does, then it is just a waste of everyone\u2019s time because the cat owner isn\u2019t looking for your product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to be very clear about the market you\u2019re going after. Instead of trying to find keywords that will help you sell a product, you should be thinking of the customer\u2019s search terms, and finding a product that will fulfill that search.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Niche Dominance<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s use \u201cred dog bowl\u201d as an example. Here is a great way to find a niche market where demand is high but the obvious keywords, dog bowl, are hyper-competitive. It would take a lot of work and giveaways to gain any traction. Now, let&#8217;s say you search for red dog bowl and the search results show a black dog bowl, and a silver dog bowl, etc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That means that Amazon couldn\u2019t find an exact match for the terms had to display similar products that aren\u2019t exactly what you\u2019re looking for. That tells me that there is an opportunity. If I am a shopper that is looking, specifically, for a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">red<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dog bowl, and my search results come up with one red dog bowl and the rest are different colours, then I will likely click on that one. This will help your click-through rate and this is called dominating a niche market, which is internet marketing 101.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Triple M Improves Conversion<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing to think about is when people have gotten on your listing, they are pretty likely to buy. As long as you don\u2019t actively put them off, they are likely to convert. So you will be getting better click-through rates as well as conversion rates. Therefore, if you\u2019re buying Amazon ads then you will be getting a better return on your investment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say you\u2019re paying $1 per click for \u201cred dog bowl\u201d and 30% of people that click end up buying, then the cost per sale. Averaged out, will be $3. Whereas, if you were to pay $2 for the keyword \u201cdog bowl\u201d and people click on it, then see several other listings that are very similar and end up clicking on another product. That conversion rate will be much lower. Let\u2019s say the conversion rate is closer to 10%, you are going to end up paying $20 per sale.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Importance of the \u201cTriple M\u201d<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find a niche market. Also, if you can find a niche market where you can supply the exact thing that people are searching for and no one else is supplying it, you can secure niche dominance and will have very good click-through and conversion rates. This will lead to fantastic sales since there is less competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next stage in message to market match is believably. If you are selling that miracle dog food to a room full of dog owners. This time you\u2019re giving it away for free. That raises the question of whether or not they can trust you. That question, I will answer, in the <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/125\">next episode<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch How &#8220;Triple M&#8221; principle can Transform Your eCommerce Business<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4ho34fAgFOQ&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F124_How_-Triple_M-_principle_can_Transform_Your_eCommerce_Business.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F124-how-triple-m-principle-can-transform-your-ecommerce-business%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/124_How_-Triple_M-_principle_can_Transform_Your_eCommerce_Business.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=1181-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/124_How_-Triple_M-_principle_can_Transform_Your_eCommerce_Business.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"124_How_-Triple_M-_principle_can_Transform_Your_eCommerce_Business.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 10:11 &#8212; 8.5MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 10:11 &#8212; 8.5MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSHow &#8220;Triple M&#8221; principle can Transform Your eCommerce Business Today I have a simple but powerful marketing principle: Triple M.
