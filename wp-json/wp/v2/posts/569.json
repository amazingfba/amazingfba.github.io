Not had a job as an employee since age 17.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Direct marketing background not SEO. Sells calendars directly to consumers, also wholesale. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Been selling on Amazon since late 1990s &#8211; e.g. old CDs, DVDs etc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Also in calendar business signed up for Amazon Advantage &#8211; media only e.g. CDs, DVDs<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In Q4 gets purchase orders. Start of season 3-4 a week; end of season say 1000 a week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">That alone pulls in six figures &#8211; and everything else on top of Amazon orders is 100% profit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">So Kevin has seen the power of Amazon grow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">2 years ago he looked into the PL model but didn\u2019t jump on it, which he regrets. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Started doing it May last year &#8211; doing some Retail Arbitrage &#8211; see how shipping and systems work. He realised RA is too much work and not scaleable. Race to the bottom. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why do PL?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Calendars are seasonal. He had pay-per-view TV revenue stream but the internet had killed that off. Plus Kevin\u2019s Background matched all the skills needed, including: <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">developing packaging, product development, online marketing -plus <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amzonestep.com\/blog\/amazon-fba-product-sourcing\/\">sourcing from China and Kore<\/a>a. So he went for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin&#8217;s philosophy is to prove a product on Amazon then take them into retail on other channels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Amazon is the bulk of his revenue. This is problematic long term because they could in theory shut your account down or suspend your best selling product at any point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Recent example: Amazon wrote to Kevin saying they\u2019re suspending his best selling product because of an image violation. They didn&#8217;t even tell Kevin what the violation was!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Kevin worked out it could be cartoons or extra elements in the images that he had put in. So he was able to deal with the issue. But it was a reminder that you&#8217;re vulnerable to some robots or some employee doing things by the book.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Where would you get started as a newbie with Product Selection? <\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>How much money do you need to start in Amazon PL?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Product selection depends on how much money you have to start with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Even Scott Voelker and other people say unrealistic things about how much you need to start. Kevin says you need a lot of money. There are stories of someone who started with $300 and made a lot of money. Some of the stories are untrue, some are true. But what\u2019s missing: five days later that person took a loan from the uncle for $10,000 &amp; 10 days later put $20,000 on the credit card. etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It paints a false picture. Some people get lucky, but it&#8217;s very rare. It takes a lot of work and a lot of money. If you just want a bit of extra holiday money you could do one of two products. But to make a living demands serious money, determination and hard work. Even Kevin didn\u2019t realise how much money it takes even with his product. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you believe in staying in one Amazon category and building a brand? Or do you pick each product on its own merits\/just follow the numbers?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In Kevin&#8217;s case, he started five brands because he came from a product background so he was a aware<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>one might not work. So he wanted to increase odds of success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Launching second product won\u2019t double sales unless it&#8217;s just an add-on or extremely complementary. So he&#8217;s not so worried about potential complementary sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">However, if you can, do get them. An example is that Kevin started in the makeup category. The problem was<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>massive competition because it was easy to get into. Now for example he sells makeup tools instead of makeup itself, and many of those are complementary [cross sales potential]. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you go about picking products? If you had $5000 to start out but potentially use credit card later? <\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>If it\u2019s capital intensive, what\u2019s your approach to finance? <\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin will make use of available credits. For example at bankrate.com you can get find credit cards listed. Like City and Chase which will give you know percent balance transfer and also wash purchases for about 15 months <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have good credit and some good history, there&#8217;re other places like a deal struck on deck etc. If you have a pro seller account for a year and the metrics look good, Amazon will offer you a decent rate on loans as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you differentiate your products on the competition?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In some cases, Kevin <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/blog\/amazon-private-label-products\/\">sources products that are straight up private label from Ali Baba<\/a>. But he makes a few changes. Every product has retail packaging. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A lot of people will take the brown box that is given by manufacturer, but customers care about the look of packaging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin doesn&#8217;t do an initial order under 1000 units &#8211; if he doesn&#8217;t have confidence in the product he won\u2019t buy it. He believes he can sell out over time if it was a dud product. It may take a year and tie up cash but you can sell anything on Amazon in time. So the risk is not that great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin picked his first product in May 2015 it took two months to get products out but that was okay because he used for long photo shoots and made a really beautiful products and packaging.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Three Product Examples.<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Example 1:<\/b> Product for dogs, just wanted to do it, the research tool said no but Kevin wants to do it anyway. It&#8217;s doing well because it&#8217;s a great positioning and marketing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He went to www.upwork.com for CAD design in Argentina which he had sketched on paper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He went to one factory that messed it up; 2nd factory<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>however made new moulds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin rarely has a hijacker because they are original. The only time that ever happens to him is when you sell the products for $0.99 to people who have accounts on review groups. So they probably have 10 accounts and they basically use it today bit of retail arbitrage..<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Example 2:<\/b> Kevin spent $30,000 dollars on creating a mould and tooling. But where the best seller is selling a product for $10, Kevin is doing it for $100. BSR doesn\u2019t matter to Kevin for that reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> The competitor is making only $1 a sale, Kevin is making $20-$30. Because Kevin has differentiation against the high end to compete, BSR does not matter to him, also at the high end of product quality and price there is less competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Example 3:<\/b> Kevin recently launched another product in the dog space. He did use tools like: <a href=\"http:\/\/asinspector.com\/\">ASIN Inspector<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/affiliate.junglescout.com\/idevaffiliate.php?id=945_2\">Jungle Scout<\/a>, other tools including Merchant Words and UberSuggest. However, all these tools are just guesses. The only numbers you can totally trust are Amazon ads results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Again, most of the competition were playing at the low end. They were the equivalent of McDonald\u2019s, whereas he wanted to create a product that was equivalent of the best steak house in town\/French chef. It&#8217;s a smaller market but enough to make it work.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>They were using cheap packaging, where is Kevin created a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>kind of cigar box type packaging. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin\u2019s product is twice as expensive as the main competition, and has half the number of products e.g. five treats instead of 20. On Friday it was put up with no promotion. He had 3 sales with no reviews. He started PPC (one sale) but it is already selling at a high price point without it. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Differentiation and going for the High End<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin makes sure to be different and go for the high end of the market [less crowded\/more profit]. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin may sometimes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thelastamazoncourse.com\/blog\/buying-from-alibaba\">go to Alibaba and source an existing product<\/a>. However he will add pieces to it change things so it is different.That might be thought of as bundling, but Kevin things it\u2019s bigger than that.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It is about changing things so it is different from the existing products. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He does not go into the model of getting it in fast and then get it shipped. He is in for the long haul, not &#8220;get rich quick\u201d. People preach that model but Kevin doesn\u2019t buy that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Differentiation and building a brand is an end to end process. It is no good skimping on the product or if you have issues, even if the packaging is good, it will still go wrong!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Building on email list from your Amazon customers<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you use a manage by stats, they will take your Amazon customer&#8217;s postal address is match them up email addresses. This is not perfect, but 30 to 40% should match up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Testing your market and their views on products<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin recently send out an email to 100 people on his email list. He had 20 responses and he email he sent out 20 units from his competitors, In plain packaging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He got great feedback on the pros and cons of different models. He also got the sales copy for his bullet and title. And he knew what was a good product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Those who raved, he went back to and asked them for reviews. He had up a dead listing for the product said that it could have reviews on. So it actually had eight reviews on it before the product went live. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Reviews &#8211; numbers and discounts<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It is a myth that you need 50 or hundred or 500 reviews. However, now you really need verified reviews. If you sell it out over 50% discount, it won\u2019t be a \u201cverified\u201d review. Customers are also getting savvy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin now sorts by verified reviews when he is searching on Amazon, and other Amazon customers are probably starting to do the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">An example of this is that Kevin got a product that got five stars reviews across the board from giveaways. But after it was\u00a0used for real, the real reviews went down fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How to maximize positive reviews &#8211; Email follow up tip<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin has the first email which does not even offer anything, it contains tips and suggestions and checks. For example if it is a potentially dangerous product, it tells the consumer to be careful when opening it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The timing of this email is crucial. Assuming that most customers use Prime, they will receive the product two days after ordering. So Kevin times this email to arrive one day off to the order. In other words it is <b><i>after <\/i><\/b>the order but<b><i> before they receive the actual product<\/i><\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He puts the question in the PS: \u201cWhy did you choose us?\u201d And offers a free gift if they onto this question. Always put something in the PS if you want someone to read it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This gives an important psychological insight before they have a product in their hands. From this he can change the listing, bullet points etc. and he gets a lot of verified reviews. About 10% respond. It gives great insight into why they hit the buy button. The product itself can negatively or positively influence them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You start to see patterns here. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Optimising\u00a0listing<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What are your main points? Photos? Title? Bullet points?<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The title is really important. The reviews the second most important thing including a video on page 20 possible. Images are also very important. If somebody&#8217;s shopping for a well-known brand, the images not so important. But for private label, they are crucial. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Packaging is also very very important. If you have great packaging, it can help you make sales with the photo of the packaging itself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> An example of improving packaging:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Kevin started with a $1 box. The new box cost $2.20 but he was able to raise the price to $40- $50, his customers didn&#8217;t feel ripped off, they felt they were getting a good deal. This is what to aim for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you look at high-end products like Apple Samsung, the packaging is absolutely critical especially somewhere as competitive as Amazon. It gives the customer confidence even if it&#8217;s not fancy, it can be a couple bucks but the spelling must be good and it must look like something they can get in a retail store. In a retail store if you think about the people by based on packaging anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You can use great packaging in your photos to catch the eye and differentiate your product. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Careful who you listen to<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The figure of \u201c 50% of full price figure to get verified reviews\u201d comes from Kevin\u2019s own testing and people who know what they are saying.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin warns that some people don&#8217;t have a clue are giving advice, in Facebook groups and even some podcasters. Some give great value but a lot of the podcasters don&#8217;t have a lot of experience selling. It varies a lot. It&#8217;s best to trust the guests are doing the numbers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">[Michael does not claim to be an expert in doing big numbers, which is why these days he focuses more on more on getting in guests who are doing big numbers, and focusing on what they have to say]<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS
