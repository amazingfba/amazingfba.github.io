This book has been a touchstone in my life for about 25 years, and when I apply the principles in this book, my life has gone better. I have found that this book is one of the most reliably realistic books about how life actually works.\u00a0<\/span>In this episode, we are covering the second habit of the seven as it pertains to goal setting, \u201cbegin with the end in mind\u201d. The first habit, \u201cbe proactive\u201d, was covered in <a href=\"\/284\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">episode 284<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><b>Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Imagine the VERY end\u2026 <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine a funeral of a loved one.

This leads to them being remembered for their positive financial legacy. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>All things are created twice<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBegin with the end in mind is based on [this] principle that all things are created twice. For example, <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Blueprint for house construction<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the construction of a home. You work with ideas until you get a clear image of what you want to build. Then you reduce it to blueprint and develop construction plans and eventually, the building will get made.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The carpenter\u2019s rule is \u2018Measure twice; cut once.\u2019\u201d This is very important when it comes to sourcing. When it comes to private labelling and custom products, getting something made for you that is not exactly right is a very expensive error. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Business Planning<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[C]learly define what you\u2019re trying to accomplish. You\u2026think through the product\u2026in terms of your target market, then you organize all the elements &#8211; financial, research and development, operations, marketing, personnel, physical facilities and so on &#8211; to meet that objective.\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your job isn\u2019t to find the perfect killer product, it\u2019s to find out what people want, and then go and work very hard to get it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMost business failures begin with the first creation, with problems such as undercapitalisation, misunderstanding of the market, or lack of a business plan.\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0This has been true in nearly every Amazon business I\u2019ve worked with. You win when you understand your target market better than everyone else. And you have to be prepared to hit the ground running when you launch in order to have the most success, which has to be planned for.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>By Design or by Default<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c\u2026all things are created twice, but not all\u2026by conscious design. \u2026if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations\u2026we reactively live the scripts handed to us by family, associates, other people\u2019s agendas\u2026\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t develop a clear plan, you\u2019ll end up with a reactive and panic-driven plan. The act of being intentional means you are more likely to end up in the right direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Leadership &amp; Management &#8211; The two Creations<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHabit 2 [Begin with the end in mind] is based on\u2026personal leadership\u2026 Leadership is not management. Management is the second creation\u2026leadership has to come first. Management is a bottom line focus: How can I best accomplish certain things? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leadership deals with the top line: What are the things I want to accomplish?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Define what you want very clearly. It\u2019s important to know what you want. Otherwise, you will never get it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things\u2019<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Drucker<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covey uses the jungle metaphor to differentiate between producers, managers, and leaders. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Producers &#8211; people with machetes, cutting through the jungle<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managers &#8211; sharpen machetes, muscle training, work schedule, paying producers<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leader &#8211; climbs tallest tree and shouts \u201cWrong jungle!\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe\u2026rapidly changing environment\u2026makes effective leadership more critical than ever. We often don\u2019t know what the trail ahead will be like or what we will need to go through it. \u2026But an inner compass will always give us direction.\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon is a very rapidly changing environment. It is critical to look at the niche you are entering and know if you can win. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEffectiveness &#8211; often even survival &#8211; does not depend solely on how much effort we expend, but on whether or not the effort we expend is in the right jungle.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Rescripting: Becoming your own first creator<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c\u2026proactivity is based on\u2026self-awareness<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2026<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two additional\u2026endowments that\u2026expand our proactivity and \u2026leadership\u2026are<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">imagination <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conscience\u2026<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Because we already live with many scripts that have been handed to us, the process of writing our own script is actually more a process of \u201crescripting\u201d or paradigm shifting.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, many people who have been employed for a long time have an assumption that the company owes something to you. They are neither out to help you or protect you, they\u2019re their for their own interest. Once you understand the focus of the company, you can use that to your advantage. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>A Personal Mission Statement <\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe most effective way I know to begin with the end in mind is to develop a personal mission statement or philosophy or creed. It focuses on what you want to be (character) and to do (contributions and achievements) and on the values or principles upon which being and doing are based.\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going through the process of developing, and creating, a mission statement is a very valuable thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201crapid change burns out a large number of people\u2026They become reactive and essentially give up, hoping that the things that happen to them will be good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could not be truer for Amazon sellers since this is one of the most rapidly changing business environments the world has ever seen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Covey, Stephen R..
