I&#8217;ve seen inside too many businesses and too many minds. It&#8217;s a hard way to start.<\/p>\n<p>All business has challenges starting. That&#8217;s a given. You need a tough mindset. I just happen to think that in late 2017, the old model just isn&#8217;t cutting for those who are trying to start selling on Amazon now.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>Are you still focussed on Private Label?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Yes I am. I believe private label on Amazon is still a big opportunity. \u00a0I have many friends making loads more money than me to back that up. It&#8217;s not theory.<\/p>\n<p>So I believe that Private label &#8211; and even better, developing unique products -works on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">However, when it comes to how to start selling on Amazon, that&#8217;s a different kettle of fish.<\/p>\n<p>I think the irony is that by prematurely plunging into private label, many sellers actually <strong>miss out on<\/strong> properly executed private label. How can that be true?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s simple really. They\u00a0\u00a0blow their budget on the first budget. They \u00a0bust their confidence in the business model, and indeed in themselves. And then they quit <strong>too early &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>and miss out on $10s or even hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue per month<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">I&#8217;m not talking about what the overall goal is &#8211; rather, \u00a0it\u2019s about how we GET there!<\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"3588\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/how-to-start-selling-on-amazon-not\/upwards-graph-on-3-gold-bars\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/upwards-graph-on-3-gold-bars.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,360\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"upwards graph on 3 gold bars\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/upwards-graph-on-3-gold-bars.jpg?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/upwards-graph-on-3-gold-bars.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3588 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/upwards-graph-on-3-gold-bars-300x169.jpg?resize=300%2C169\" alt=\"Start selling on amazon upwards graph on 3 gold bars\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/upwards-graph-on-3-gold-bars.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/upwards-graph-on-3-gold-bars.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2>Whatever Works is good<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p4\">Also I\u2019m increasingly happy with whatever WORKS rather than being puritanical about business models.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">As I&#8217;ve talked over the past two years to many Amazon experts, it&#8217;s clear from the sharper people (especially the master himself, <a href=\"http:\/\/linkhere.com\">Will Tjernlund ) <\/a>\u00a0that there are several models that can work.

But he&#8217;s basically little more than a trained monkey.<br \/>\nPut him in any situation that demands real understanding of music, or real control of a piano, and he is finished.<\/p>\n<p>My experience with Amazon sellers who try to learn \u00a0how to start selling on Amazon with Private label is remarkably similar.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, it mirrors my own journey as an Amazon seller myself. And it also mirrors my journey as a piano student\/musician to a frighteningly similar degree too.<\/p>\n<h2>Vested interests trump real learning<\/h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s not surprising. There are a lot of vested interests in trying to &#8220;pre-package&#8221; business building skills and mindset.

On the contrary. It&#8217;s the ranting of an ex-professional).<\/p>\n<p>Both things, I&#8217;m afraid, while much better than doing nothing in terms of progressing, are basically based on a totally false premise. The false premise being that you can learn the piano by aping much better pianists&#8217; <em>external<\/em> results &#8211; or by aping the <em>actions<\/em>\u00a0of advanced Amazon sellers.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, what I&#8217;ve seen overwhelmingly is that all of us entrepreneurs need to develop the right mindset and skills.

Everyone has to learn how the mechanics of production, freight and amazon work. You need to get familiar with Amazon&#8217;s internal processes.<\/p>\n<p>All this takes time and practice.

That&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s also not the time to take big risks!<br \/>\n<h2>MOQs and freight costs from China &#8211;<\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\">these nearly always make for a rather unpalatable large upfront order. It&#8217;s all relative of course. If you have \u00a310-20K to invest, you might get away with a budget of \u00a32-3K per order plus some giveaway money. Not for any serious product in the USA, though. And for most people, that&#8217;s about half their money for Amazon, in my experience.<br \/>\n<h3>Cashflow<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\">It usually takes months to get a decent private label product off the ground. The fastest I&#8217;ve personally done it was four months, with a business partner &#8211; so we had a combined 4 years of Amazon experience at the time and access to some very experienced people. It&#8217;s still challenging enough.<\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\">That means no money coming in at all for months.<\/li>\n<li>AND a large lump sum out a few months in.<br \/>\n<h2>TIME TILL YOU START SELLING<\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<li>It takes months to get a PL product off the ground.<\/li>\n<li>Meanwhile you\u2019re not learning from the marketplace directly &#8211; you&#8217;re an outsider attempting to learn from the rather minimal data Amazon releases. Data which the rest of the planet is also trying to learn from. This is a huge downside.<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;re not learning to ship in products or deal with Amazon systems. That&#8217;s a large learning curve. The sooner you can start the better<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;re not getting access to Amazon business reports with more insider information like conversion percentages<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;re not getting access to the Search Term Reports which I believe are the <em>real\u00a0<\/em>value you&#8217;ll get from Amazon ads. That&#8217;s where you find out keyword-level conversion percentages which is VERY powerful info.<\/li>\n<li>you\u2019re also not earning! See the cashflow issue above.<br \/>\n<h2>The percentage of successes is so low!<\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<li>This is the real kicker, I&#8217;m afraid. I do know several people who started with private labelling and are still at it today and making great money. Maybe 10-15 people. Maybe 20 max.<\/li>\n<li>However, I must have known hundreds people (vaguely known of at any rate) who started around the same time as me, or have drifted into (and out of) the <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/fb\">Amazing FBA Facebook group<\/a>\u00a0.

I think the opportunities to make a ton of cash and have the satisfaction of becoming a real entrepreneur (and mastering a tricky but addictive craft) are very real with private label.
