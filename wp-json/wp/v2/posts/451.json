About 3 years ago, he started buying items wholesale and sold them on Amazon. As that got more competitive, he switched to Private Label products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What is difference between Private Label vs. Wholesale model?\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Wholesale: buy welk\u00a0known brands from wholesaler, then sell\u00a0on existing listings and rotate through the buy box, which is\u00a0normally about the lowest price. 3 years ago that was okay, but it became very competitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">With PL, you own the listing; \u00a0since it is your product, you can justify work getting reviews, nice photos etc. Greg never did the Retail Arbitrage (RA) model because it is not scalable. Greg was looking for a system, not exchanging hours for dollars<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Why develop <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/junglescout\">Jungle Scout<\/a>?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The biggest bottle neck in Greg\u2019s business was finding more products. At one point he had a team of 8 VAs in the Philippines who would look at ideas, fill out a spreadsheet. This is when he created the Jungle Scout Chrome extension is the same as the VAs &#8211; instead of 30 minutes, it takes 2 seconds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Greg was trying to scale fast, so with a list of 200 keywords, one person (VA) could only get through 20 a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What is <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/junglescout\">Jungle Scout <\/a>and how do you use it?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Two tools: Chrome extension and Web App. (Chrome is a free browser you can download)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Extension integrates into browser &#8211; look on Amazon, click on JS button &#8211; pop gives you the relevant data to make decisions on products or sales. Data like price, how much you nett after fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/affiliate.junglescout.com\/idevaffiliate.php?id=945_2\">Web App<\/a>: Web based software that runs on the Jungle Scout website. It has several features &#8211; the most popular is the product Dat abase. It\u2019s a rebuild of Amazon\u2019s catalogue<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>for Sellers, rather than buyers (which is what Amazon.com is designed for), with filters \u00a0with your criteria -for example:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Sales:\u00a0over 300 a month;\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">and under 50 reviews; priced over $20, under 1 lb weight\u201d .<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What are your criteria for product selection?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This is for the USA store but a variation would work in UK etc. For example for keyword &#8220;Glass cups&#8221;-<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Demand: 3000 units a month of demand<\/b> [on page 1 of search results].\u00a0If doing manually, add up all the sales of \u201cglass cups\u201d (eliminate irrelevant results).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">That is a good number if you are aiming to sell 10 a day yourself (300 a month) &#8211; which is 10% of the total market.\u00a0That\u2019s easy to find but we want lower competition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Competition<\/strong>: <strong>1 or 2 sellers in top 5 listings with under 50 reviews<\/strong>. \u00a0And\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">in<strong> top 10 sellers, 3 or 4 listings with under 50 reviews<\/strong>. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">This tells you it\u2019s not too mature a niche. IF competition has hundreds of reviews, you\u2019ll find it hard to compete.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Big picture: it\u2019s a small %age of all listings on Amazon &#8211; but there are 100s of Millions of products on Amazon so that\u2019s a lot of items!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Price<\/strong>: $20 or more. The smaller the simpler the better- easier for storage etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These are just rules of thumb &#8211; it can be good if it\u2019s a bit less demand but a bit Less\u00a0competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Every time I found a product I liked using the Product tracker, it looked hyper competitive. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">How can I use the Chrome extension to find lower competition products?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The best tool is actually not the Extension, it\u2019s best to use the Product Database on the Web App.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can put in your criteria for products with under 50 reviews and min 3000 units sold a month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">You can do this with the Chrome Extension. Once you HAVE an idea, the Extension\u00a0is the best tool to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">But if you don\u2019t already have product\/ Keyword ideas, it\u2019s not the best tool .\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">In every category it looks like it\u2019s good to PL. What are the other criteria for selection?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If every opportunity looks good, your criteria for competition is too lax. There are tons of opportunities with high demand but they have a lot of competition. Look for something with under 50 reviews in some of those top spots &#8211; easy to do with the Extension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Only add up the demand for relevant listing results. Eliminate irrelevant searches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What are the costs of the <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/junglescout\">Chrome Extension <\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.junglescout.com\/#pricing\">Web App<\/a>?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The Extension is for $90 or $150 (more features) one off costs<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The Web App\u00a0at the monthly $40 level is good for most people but goes up to $100 a month. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">There is a free trial &#8211; and you can find lots of products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Are there plans to make the\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">Web App<\/span> available in the UK?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The Extension\u00a0already works in the UK. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">The Web App\u00a0will be built for UK in the near future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">But UK or Germany based sellers still use the Web App for the USA to get product ideas &#8211; you could then search in the UK store and verify that. A lot of the times you\u2019ll find a good opportunity in the USA and it will be in the UK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>&#8220;There seem to be three schools of thought with product selection &#8211; 1. find &amp; build a niche brand of related products so you can sell over and over to the same customers, 2. hunt for single superstars \/ hidden gems, 3. gut instinct. perhaps you find\/invent a product you think would do great, or it&#8217;s selling in another venue and has no rep\/history on amazon to give informed decisions.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/junglescout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jungle Scout<\/a> and tools like it seem to be targeted at product selection style 2 [Superstars], how can it best be used to help with styles 1[Niche] &amp; 3 [Instinct], or indeed does Greg believe in these styles or have a different view entirely?&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For Greg, gut instinct is out because it\u2019s risky- he likes to use the data. It might work for some people!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">GM has about 3 dozen items &#8211; When Greg first started, he was advised to create a whole line of products to get better sales [cross sales]. Greg didn\u2019t find that to be true. He did it start with but didn\u2019t see increase in sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When people shop on Amazon, they are not looking for particular brand, they just want the best reviews at the best price.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">So now Greg just finds opportunities and sells them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">However, If you wanted to find products similar to your existing products, in the Web App, you could select the product category.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The marketplace has given feedback that \u201cfinding gems\u201d has worked better than Niche market approach. Maybe in certain categories, brand <i>Is <\/i>more important; just not in Greg\u2019s market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">People are searching for the item and then getting one of the top 3 depending on reviews and price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>How do you deal with the competition? Especially how do you avoid a price war?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Greg never competes on price &#8211; he always works on pictures, the listing; improvements to product. If his competitor lowers price, he doesn\u2019t. When launching new products, get into area that isn\u2019t too competitive. Then by the time competition comes in, secure the top spot with lots of reviews.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Lots of people think they are too late to the party. Not true. It\u2019s still a great opportunity. Greg is still launching new products. BUT You just have to be good with product research. If you pick an item that\u2019s in a very competitive niche, it\u2019s very hard to get anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You can\u2019t fix a product at the marketing stage if the product selection is wrong!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If sales volume is dropping, Instead of lowering your price, do some giveaways and keep sales rank and overall, it will make you more money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">BUT Product selection is so important that lots of people get hung up on it. How do get round the selection deadlock (Paralysis analysis)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Use the criteria that Greg gave &#8211; it\u2019s proven, including a case study\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you\u2019ve done lots of research, you will have a better feel for a particular market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If in doubt, if you\u2019re worried and just beginning, just choose even lower competition product even if you just sell say 5 a day. And or place an order for fewer units.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I know the Pro Extension will give extra info like FBA Fees, FBA Fulfillment category (eg oversize), net price after fees and so on. <\/span><\/strong><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Is this available for Amazon UK?<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, it is!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">How about .de (Germany) or other European marketplaces?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Not yet, but this summer (2016), it should be available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS PODCAST<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A podcast is a free downloadable audio show that enables you to learn while you\u2019re on the go.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>To subscribe to my podcast for free, you\u2019ll need an app to listen to the show from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For iPhone\/iPad\/iPod listeners \u2013 Grab your phone or device and go to the iTunes store and search \u201cAmazing FBA\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will help you to download the free Podcasts App (produced by Apple) and then subscribe to the show from within that app.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Every time I produce a new episode, you\u2019ll get it downloaded right on yt sentence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For podcast enthusiasts \u2013 If you already listen to podcasts and have a podcatcher that you prefer, the feed you\u2019ll need to add is: http:\/\/ amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who don\u2019t have a mobile device \u2013 You can always listen to the show by clicking the audio file at the top of this page.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_49\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=49\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Product Research With Greg Mercer of Jungle Scout &#8211; Part 1 of 2<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zZVMPSSra6Y&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F_42_V4_Greg_Mercer_of_Jungle_Scout-_Part_1_Amazon_Product_Research-auphonic.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F42-amazon-product-research-with-greg-mercer-of-jungle-scout-part-1%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-2\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_42_V4_Greg_Mercer_of_Jungle_Scout-_Part_1_Amazon_Product_Research-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=451-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_42_V4_Greg_Mercer_of_Jungle_Scout-_Part_1_Amazon_Product_Research-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"_42_V4_Greg_Mercer_of_Jungle_Scout-_Part_1_Amazon_Product_Research-auphonic.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 38:49 &#8212; 35.5MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Why did Greg Mercer start private labelling on Amazon?
