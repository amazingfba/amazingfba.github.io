You can make the same sales with lower working capital. That&#8217;s less money invested. You can have stronger cashflow. Meaning it&#8217;s safer. In addition, you can also make more sales. A LOT more sales. AND more profits!<\/p>\n<p>There are HUGE wins to be got from this.

It does include art to a degree. That said, using data as a starting point <i>and <\/i>as a check on your theories is critical.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re starting out, you may use rules like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\u201cNext 30 days\u2019 sales =roughly last 30 days\u201d<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\u201cA Q4 Month = typical month X200%\u201d<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\u201cJune Sales this year= last year\u2019s sales for June X 1.3\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are a start but usually not good enough. You need to base your forecasts on the best quality data you can get. Otherwise, you could quickly find yourself with <b>Overstock inventory [int link]. Or <\/b>you could be <b>out of stock [int link] <\/b>in your bestsellers. Both of them are terrible for cash flow. And going out of stock is terrible for sales AND profits. So it&#8217;s worth working hard on <b>to improve demand forecasting [int link].<\/b><\/p>\n<h3>The Limitations of your own data in forecasting sales<\/h3>\n<p>People worry about <b><i>how<\/i><\/b><b> to forecast revenue based on historical data . <\/b>But, it&#8217;s important to be realistic about the true value of your historical data. The value of the data for any product line will depend on how long it has been selling:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Under 3-4 months. <\/b>Seasonality has not been accounted for. You may be misjudging demand based on a single unusually slow or good sales quarter.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Under a year<\/b>. You have some perspective. You&#8217;ll have a low and a high month or months. Yet , you have no year-on-year comparison. This can still give you a poor prediction. That&#8217;s especially true if you&#8217;ve never sold the product in its peak seas on (eg Q4 for giftable products or summer for camping products, etc.). It&#8217;s common for peak month sales to double or triple an average month. But not guaranteed! Hence your dilemma&#8230;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>You have well over a year&#8217;s data. <\/b>This gives you year-on-year comparisons. While more reliable, you should not take last year as a blind template for the coming year.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>The solution: monitor your competition<\/h3>\n<p>If you have little data or short time periods, it&#8217;s best to take your internal data with a pinch of salt. I&#8217;d advise you to use software to monitor your competitors&#8217; sales over time. Then you can see trends within your market niche. Take your internal data and blend it with market data. That gives you a much better chance of <b>forecasting demand<\/b> well.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, the global economic outlook and your knowledge of your industry must also factor in.<\/p>\n<p>Forecasting sales is a black art. Frankly, nobody gets it right 100% of the time. Or gets it 100% right any of the time! But the more accurately you can predict, the better your business will be.

You need to calculate your safety stock. This\u00a0 is the inventory that you add on top of your lead time forecasts once you think you&#8217;ve got the right number! This is to account for the fact that you&#8217;l probably get it wrong. Above all it&#8217;s to try to minimise the danger of going out of stock.<\/p>\n<p>A rule of thumb is to add a month&#8217;s worth of stock. But this needs tweaking depending on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>how much cash you can afford to tie up in a product line (less cash means you have to have a lower safety stock and take greater risks of running out of stock)<\/li>\n<li>how consistently well this product has sold (which implies having greater safety stock)<\/li>\n<li>whether a product or product group represent a big % of your sales (if so, that also implies more safety stock)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Beware the &#8220;low expenses&#8221; fallacy<\/h3>\n<p>A general early-stage business delusion can appear here. That error is: failing to account for the real costs of an operation. Let&#8217;s assume you (the stressed business owner-operator) are doing the<b> Amazon inventory management.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Well, just because you&#8217;re not paying yourself doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s no cost to your work. Yes, it doesn&#8217;t show up in any standard financial statements. But the opportunity cost [external link?] of you not doing other work is real.<\/p>\n<p>You should definitely work hard to get better at <b>inventory forecasting. <\/b>But you need to get the mechanics off your desk.<\/p>\n<p>Rules-based <b>stock management software<\/b> limitations.<\/p>\n<h3>The next stage &#8211; rules based inventory management software<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re beyond the first few $10,000 in monthly revenue, or into 2 digits of SKUs, it&#8217;s time to move up. You&#8217;ll need to move beyond this level for some serious reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It\u2019s labour-intensive and demands good skill (and thus real cost).<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Manual prediction is often (mostly) very inaccurate.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The static nature of spreadsheet data means it&#8217;s not accounting for change over time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The traditional semi-automated solution has been a rules-based system. While that saves your fingers typing on a spreadsheet, it still has limits:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">it\u2019s primitive. Whether or your staff do this, Or a rules-based system\u2026 The result is the same: Your predictions do NOT match reality! They can be off by a solid amount.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">That treats all products as equally valuable!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Almost <b>everybody<\/b> has <b>heard <\/b>of \u201cThe 80\/20 Rule\u201d\u2026 One mastermind member actually <b>did <\/b>such an 80\/20 analysis. Out of 300 product lines, Just TEN were giving over half of his profit! (pure 80\/20 in fact) AND YET\u2026 So few of us actually do this.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because It\u2019s hard to do &#8211; And because it\u2019s hard to find the time!<\/p>\n<p>When you&#8217;ve identified which products to restock, you&#8217;ll need to answer a few questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">How much <b>stock<\/b> do you need for each product?<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">What is the budget for it?<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">And which products will you get the biggest return on your cash?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These systems are better than manually implementing stock management rules. But you should definitely monitor these systems yourself at this stage. Or have a trusted experienced employee do so.<\/p>\n<p>By the time you&#8217;re doing over say $20,000 a month in sales or have over 20 SKUs, it may be time to move on up to move up again.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"13399\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/amazon-inventory-management\/machine-learning\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/machine-learning.png?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,360\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"machine learning\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/machine-learning.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/machine-learning.png?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-13399\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/machine-learning.png?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/machine-learning.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/machine-learning.png?resize=65%2C65&amp;ssl=1 65w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/machine-learning.png?resize=220%2C220&amp;ssl=1 220w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/machine-learning.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/machine-learning.png?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 450w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>The next stage of inventory management<\/h3>\n<p>What you need at this stage is a system, not a spreadsheet. It needs to be based on proper algorithms, and be based on solid data. We&#8217;ve discussed the limitations of using data only from your own seller account. So ideally such a system can gather data from many other Amazon seller accounts in your category.<\/p>\n<p>It needs to be a system that learns based on <b>results<\/b>; one that will show the cash required. Above all, it should show which products will get you the highest return if you restock them.<\/p>\n<p>All business growth is about getting the greatest return on cash, effort and time invested. It&#8217;s the same with <b>Amazon inventory management.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>Machine-<\/b><b>learning\u00a0 inventory management software<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The machine-learning<strong> inventory management software<\/strong> could give you the <b>biggest <\/b>and <b>quickest<\/b> profit increase. Justifying the costs at this stage of business growth are pretty easy. Just make sure that the system ticks a couple of boxes:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>\u201cmachine learning\u201d <\/b>means a system that learns from experience and adjusts actions accordingly. (NOT based on fixed rules)<\/li>\n<li>it ties in two other components.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>What, two <i>more <\/i>things to think about, Mike?<\/p>\n<p>Sorry yes. It&#8217;s reality. If you want to make more money in the real world, that&#8217;s what you have to deal with!<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s vital to tie in two other components to inventory management:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b> Pricing<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you lower your price to get sales\u2026 \u2026but you run out of stock\u2026 you make lower profits. Pricing to stay in stock is <b>crucial. <\/b>And there is a dynamic relationship between stock levels and pricing. This us why in the end you need the sophistication of an artificial intelligence system.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><b>Advertising<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you run ads to get sales\u2026 \u2026but you run out of stock\u2026 Again you\u2019re losing potential profits.

Delegate the day-to-day stock management to your system. But remember: you&#8217;re responsible for your business&#8217;s success. And stock management is too central to its success to ignore.
