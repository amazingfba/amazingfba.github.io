What are you going to give up in 2017? Before you start doing something, you need to stop doing something else. You must free up your time, money, and mental focus. Today we will be discussing sponsored ads, or Amazon ads. Amazon calls them sponsored ads. Broadly speaking, they are one of a few ways you can that drive traffic that is moderately guaranteed to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Ads<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a product with terrible conversion rates and a decent amount of reviews and that\u2019s not shifting over time, and you\u2019re driving traffic with pay-per-click, then you have a problem with your product or listing. But if you have decent sales and the conversion rate isn\u2019t terrible, not below 10%, then what is going to determine your profit will be the balance between the sales price and the cost of goods sold. A big percentage of that is your Amazon ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you increase your price you could negatively affect your sales, however, if you reduce your cost, by reducing money spent on Amazon ads, then you will increase your profit while maintaining your sales. Which is obviously a big win for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is very important to use negative keywords if you\u2019re using auto-campaign. I always suggest using auto-campaign to start with because you can gather a lot of data and tune the algorithm to your listing. \u00a0But after a while (say 1-2 weeks usually) you shouldn\u2019t be spending a large bid-per-click on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Negative Keywords<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go through your search term report, and anything you\u2019re spending a lot of money on, that doesn\u2019t bring you sales, is something you want to put in negative keywords fairly soon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How\u00a0soon? Well, if you are really serious about your products, you have signs of good success on your hands, and deep pockets, you might want to run a loss on that campaign for a rather long time in order to gather data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have 50 clicks on a keyword and no sales, that pretty certain that it\u2019s not working. You\u2019ll want to make sure that\u2019s a negative match keyword. However, to get 50 clicks, you likely spent a lot of money and you might want to have a cutoff at 5, 10, or 20 clicks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next thing you want to look at is the keywords that are making sales. These\u00a0are probably going to be a small percentage of all the keywords you\u2019re using. Over time, you\u2019ll start gathering your long-tail keywords, but starting out, it\u2019ll likely be around 10-15. That all depends on how much you\u2019re willing to spend before you make sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you want to be really harsh, after two to three weeks you\u2019ll have your 10-15 keywords that are making you sales. You\u2019ll want to look at those and reduce the bids on those which are costing you too high of advertising cost of sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Cost of Sales Metric<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One caveat, don\u2019t allow advertising costs of sales to be your main guiding point. When you launching products, you\u2019ll be raising your prices over time. For example, if you\u2019re spending $10 on advertising on a product you\u2019re selling for $10. That\u2019s 100% ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sales). Over time, you might raise the price to $15 which change that ACoS\u00a0dramatically. So I wouldn&#8217;t recommend using that as a metric. It can be misleading until you land at a stable price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I would recommend looking at is the overall spend on advertising divided by the overall sales. A very simple, robust metric that you should monitor weekly at least.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This isn\u2019t something Amazon will give you because they want you to spend money on advertising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s very simple to calculate. Get the same time period for both; you can get your advertising costs from the seller central &#8220;Advertising&#8221; tab, and you add up how much you spent. Then you go back to your business reports, and add up the sales you made in the same exact period period. Then just take your advertising costs and divide them by your sales. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main thing is that it\u2019s not about the advertising cost of sales, it about profit. If my profit margin on an item, before advertising, is $3, then I can spend $3 on advertising before it becomes a loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another thing to consider, is that, if you have a decent selling product, you may be willing to run at 100% ACoS. That is, you\u2019re running a loss on those sales from ads. You will still rank organically because of the ads, and you can make your money from organic sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if you\u2019re not being aggressive and really looking to grow your sales volume.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I prefer to keep my ACoS\u00a0where it is break-even. Let\u2019s say I am selling a widget for $10, and my total cost before Amazon ads, including Amazon fees and fulfillment costs etc, is $7. That means, before ads, my profit margin is $3. I would not want to spend more than $3 per sale averaged over all my ads. That means that all sales gained via Amazon Ads are at breakeven or better, and that all organic sales represent profit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional Help<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know this is complicated and it\u2019s not really meant to be an instruction guide for pay-per-click ads. If it\u2019s the sort of thing you need help with and you want to get in touch with me, I do offer a one-off call with you through <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/clarity.fm\/amazingfba\/precall?c=t&amp;utm_source=blog_widget_request&amp;utm_medium=blog_widget_request&amp;utm_term=widget_amazingfba_101921&amp;utm_campaign=blog_widget_request\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clarity FM<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s \u00a0$2\/minute so it\u2019s an expensive way of working with me. You\u2019d be better off joining <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/mentoring\/\">my mentorship program<\/a>\u00a0if you want ongoing help. Al<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">though I\u2019m pretty strict about who I work with, \u00a0I do have room for one or two more people.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re interested, still apply, and don\u2019t assume I won\u2019t work with you. Just read the guidelines and FAQs first though. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Another, inexpensive, way to work with me, as well of several others, is to become a part of the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/mastermind\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mastermind group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The London mastermind is in full swing and we\u2019ve had meetups with about 6-10 people, which is perfect. We have dates set from January to June if you\u2019re interested in working with me and up to 10 other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PPC Entourage<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One last word on pay-per-click, I am trying out some software called <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/ppcentourage.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PPC Entourage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which they claim will help you manage your pay-per-click very quickly and easily.
