However, it is still got rejected by the customs. <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">It seems FEIN is required if i want to ship my inventory to FBA.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I am not trying to escape any tax issues, but to get a FEIN number, I would need a legal address in US. I am not in US. <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">How do you guys deal with this?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A freight forwarder isn\u2019t the same as a Customs Broker in the USA. Some companies do both, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernoverseas.com\/global\/AboutUs\/whychooseus.aspx\">Western Overseas Corporation<\/a>. But it sounds like what you need is a Customs Broker. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You shouldn\u2019t need a US address to get an EIN as a foreign entity (person or company). But if you need one (you do need a returns address for amazon or should at least have one), google. I used <a href=\"http:\/\/myaddressus.com\"><span class=\"s2\">myaddressus.com<\/span><\/a> &#8211; pretty cheap. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you send in goods over the value of $2500, it\u2019s a formal import so you\u2019ll need a customs bond etc. At that point, I would use a Customs Broker, at least for the first time. That&#8217;s not the case here, but worth flagging up for future reference.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Q2 Ben <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Here is my newbie experience post #3. So I\u2019ve been selling for about 3 weeks in the UK. Where am I?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I picked a great product. It\u2019s flying off the cyber-shelves. I am about \u00bd way up page 1 for all my main keywords. I told myself to be \u2018happy\u2019 with 5 units a day. I was averaging 10-12 units per day, but have increased my price and now average 7-8 units per day. I have had days of 10+ including a day of 16 units. These are not giveaways, all giveaways were done in the first week. So why did I increase the price?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">This first \u2018test run\u2019 was 500 units. At the current rate, I\u2019m going to run out quickly. So I\u2019m trying to find the balance between maintaining sales, and not running out of inventory. Am still undercutting some competitors at the current price, but also more expensive than some others.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I believe the reasons it\u2019s going well so far are:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1. Branding. My brand is easily one of the coolest, and as I expand I\u2019ll grow as a brand, rather than as \u201cBob\u2019s generic stuff\u201d which several of my competitors are doing<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. Social media. Many \u2018gurus\u2019 say \u2013 avoid social media until you are well established on Amazon. This is not a good move, in my opinion. I have an active twitter and Instagram account, and a new facebook page. OK I haven\u2019t got many followers, but t\u2019s growing and I\u2019m getting a bit of engagement.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. Branding. I said it again because it\u2019s so important. Branding is everything. Cool brands get bought. Generic crap doesn\u2019t.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Comments<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Alex \u00a0You are doing well, but don&#8217;t talk about brand building. People don&#8217;t care. You drive them in your page and they just see information, reviews and price. Just set Ppc automatic. If doesn&#8217;t work move on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Suzi I love to hear that you are growing a strong brand, and that you understand and appreciate how important it is. I cringe so hard when I hear people say your branding doesn&#8217;t matter&#8230;nothing can be further from the truth. Have you had any issues with counterfeits hopping on your listing(s)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My response: it depends!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you just want to make sales on Amazon short-term (say next 6 months), I think it&#8217;s true that brand doesn&#8217;t matter much. Initially, customers will not have heard of your brand yet, and they mostly go with good images and price. Also, it is not realistic to expect Amazon to cross-sell your products even if they are in the same niche.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, if you want to create a defensible business to later sell, you definitely need to create a brand.\u00a0Also, even if you&#8217;re never planning to sell, if you want to create a Shopify store, to diversify and lower the risk of Amazon controlling\u00a0your business, \u00a0you will need to develop a focussed suite of products. If you have multiple niches, you can develop multiple brand sites, but each one needs some unity for credibility.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Also if you do well, medium term even on Amazon, people can start searching for your brand or pay slightly higher prices for it, as long as you have lots of reviews by that stage.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Q3 David <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">EMAIL OPTIMIZATION: Hey Everyone&#8230;just a quick question regarding your post-purchase email autoresponder sequences. I am currently getting 8% and 9% conversion rates for feedback and reviews, respectively. I would like to increase this and was thinking of shortening each email to make more mobile friendly. Have any of you tested the length of copy an how this alters conversions? Thanks!<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">First of all, if you&#8217;re getting 8-9% conversion, you&#8217;re doing well. Average for most people I&#8217;ve spoken to about this (which was a while ago) was 5%, as it was for me last time I checked.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Regarding testing, I don&#8217;t know whether for example Feedback Genius or Salesbacker\u00a0will do this for you automatically. I use a different system so I don&#8217;t think I have that option.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you want to do it manually, then make sure you test a significantly statistically meaningful number. So I would be inclined to run three variations, one shorter\u00a0and one longer, and I would try each of them for about 100 sales each.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Re.\u00a0email follow-up sequences more broadly, I use three emails.\u00a0Currently the 1st only offers help and a PDF and says thanks\/please get in touch if any issues although Kevin King asks &#8220;why did you buy the product&#8221; which I may change to going forward.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The 2nd, after ben Cummings&#8217;s approach, asks the buyer to just hit REPLY and let me know why s\/he bought the product. Similar to Kevin King but<em> after<\/em> the\u00a0product has arrived. Only a small %age do but you do get replies in my experience.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">THe 3rd then asks for Seller Feedback, which I can then follow up on and ask to be changed to review if it ends up being about the product. It&#8217;s a filtering mechanism.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">THe point of the 2nd email is that if someone replies to that, they feel more obliged to follow through after the 3rd and actually write a review.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In David&#8217;s case, I&#8217;d be inclined not to mess with what is working too much but tweak it eg longer\/shorter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Or you could change the 1st email in the sequence. Or the 3rd. Test both variations and let us know!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Branding for PL does it matter  Q&#038;A Tuesday no 12  part 1<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P_vhEu3YUj4&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Branding for PL does it matter  Q&#038;A Tuesday no 12  part 2<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dZR7jS6nffI&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F_76_Q_A_Tuesday_No._12.m4a&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F76-importing-to-usa-brand-building-email-followup-q-a-tuesday-no-12%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_m4a\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_76_Q_A_Tuesday_No._12.m4a\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=733-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_76_Q_A_Tuesday_No._12.m4a\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"_76_Q_A_Tuesday_No._12.m4a\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 26:37 &#8212; 47.4MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 26:37 &#8212; 47.4MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSQ 1 Corinne First, I am not an American but want to sell [on] Amazon.com I have sent a few small packages to Amazon FBA.
