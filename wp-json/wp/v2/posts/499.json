Not really. AL saw a video on PL on Amazon and that was it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How come Private Label?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">AL was taught only PL and that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. He only knows about wholesale from <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/45\/\">Will Tjernlund<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you sell only on <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\"><span class=\"s2\">amazon.com<\/span><\/a> or also in the UK and\/or Europe?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Currently in the USA. Everyone expands their business in their own way. AL has decided to focus on building off Amazon rather than expand Amazon internationally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<b>How do you find products?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The \u201cStandard\u201d answer: try to find things that you use. Walk around kitchen\/dining room and when you see something that you use, you will able to ID with target demographic because you are in it!\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">(About 2 products found this way). Makes figuring out Customer Avatar much less complex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Then check the numbers to see if other people are making money with the product. If they check out, go deeper. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The \u201creal answer\u201d: Decide on a Category e.g. kitchen. Then look in the relevant dept at the shops, in your friend\u2019s cupboard &#8211; become mindful and the universe will show you a product! [Then check the numbers]<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you believe in staying in one Amazon category? Or do you pick each product on its own merits\/just follow the numbers?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Start with product on own merits. Then plan to expand into the category with your brand. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Then start thinking of the implications &#8211; what are complementary products?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you deal with the increased competition in the Private Label Amazon market( esp. USA)?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A lot of people look at the competition &#8211; there is a lot of \u201csky is falling\u201d thinking!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The days you could trip over something to make $100K a month are over but that was always going to be short lived. Now it\u2019s just levelling out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">BUT The idea it\u2019s too saturated is silly. More people starting on Amazon leads to new products on Amazon which create new markets &#8211; also if you intro a new product, you\u2019re the only seller!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You don\u2019t sell a product and have an Amazon business; you have a physical prods biz and Amazon is just a channel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you use other sales or marketing channels?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Took a while to learn that FBA is the most affordable fulfillment centre. AL spend 6 months looking for alternatives but Amazon is the best!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The next was finding companies to connect Amazon FBA to other channels. AL has put products on <a href=\"https:\/\/jet.com\/\">Jet<\/a> &#8211; long approval process &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ebay.com\/\">eBay<\/a> templates are being built. Next month going on Sears, Rakatan. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.co.uk\/\">Shopify<\/a> site is nearly up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tell us more about a \u201cCustomer Avatar\u201d?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you sell anything, you always have an ideal customer\/target demographic. Person most likely to see, love and buy your product. Focus on them and don\u2019t go broad &#8211; you will miss easily sales if your message is too diluted. Focus language- when you\u2019re writing bullets\/description e.g. if you sell male enhancement, the language is men \u201che\/him\u201detc. &#8211; refine that ever deeper the more you know your avatar. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">\u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/getaskbook.com\/\">Ask<\/a>\u201d by Ryan Levesque (on Smart Passive Income podcast) uses surveys for this. \u00a0Do you do this? <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s hard to do this because Amazon\u2019s customers are not your customers. But once you have an email list, it\u2019s very powerful, yes. But until you have that, just pay attention to your data. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you run FB ads, look at the demographics and over time build a picture. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Gender, age range etc. e.g. Baby market &#8211; AL started with idea of just mums but gradually got more specific. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Surveying your own audience\/buyers really does give you amazing results.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, it is very important who you\u2019re hitting <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">[<a href=\"http:\/\/andrechaperon.com\/\">Andre Chaperon<\/a> the email marketing &#8220;guru&#8221; is obsessed with Customer Avatar]. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Dealing with increasing competition &#8211; from moderate to tough. How do you deal with this?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Before AL used to say: &#8220;Find a product and do it really well.&#8221; \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Now it\u2019s: \u201cHe who has the most SKUs wins\u201d. [SKU=Shelf Keeping Unit, i.e. a product line]<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">When you start out, \u00a0<span class=\"s1\"> &#8220;f<\/span><span class=\"s1\">ailing&#8221; may be that your listing is buried in page X. \u00a0O<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\">nce you get to the point where you know what you\u2019re doing,<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0&#8220;failure&#8221;=selling only 5 a day of a product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But if you have 300 product lines doing 5 sales, that\u2019s a living! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Having a fleshed out catalogue is<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>great for your brand. if you approach wholesalers you\u2019re better placed. there are many benefits. It\u2019s a very capital intensive approach but all of Amazon products business is capital intensive so you just have to be very intelligent with your product choices of inventory and expansion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you make intelligent choices i.e. use of capital?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Most people come in thinking &#8220;If I can make $8000 sales\/mo at 45% margin i could quit my job.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">AL says: &#8220;Keep your job and reinvest your money for 5 years.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">With a traditional business, you would give it 5-10 years before you give up on it. So why not with Amazon?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s a tough sacrifice but if you reinvest everything repeatedly, you\u2019ll really build out your cat and have more options. That and intelligently using credit. Business credit cards are building AL\u2019s credit and opening new SKUs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Where would you advise using credit and where avoid?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you can afford to make 3X the minimum payment per month, then using a credit card to expand your brand is okay. So in the end, that won\u2019t hurt your credit. What you do have is new inventory to make new money off. This is a strategy if you have<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>couple of products doing pretty well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re starting out, it\u2019s more of a risk. AL did max out 3 credit cards to start because he had no capital. It\u2019s a personal choice. But it\u2019s not a good idea to take out credit for a highly competitive product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What sort of margin would you aim for in general?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Aim for 50-55%. It never works out that way because of competition and price wars. AL has an average across all SKUs of 36%. But the wiggle room is there now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS PODCAST<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A podcast is a free downloadable audio show that enables you to learn while you\u2019re on the go.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>To subscribe to my podcast for free, you\u2019ll need an app to listen to the show from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For iPhone\/iPad\/iPod listeners \u2013 Grab your phone or device and go to the iTunes store and search \u201cAmazing FBA\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will help you to download the free Podcasts App (produced by Apple) and then subscribe to the show from within that app.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Every time I produce a new episode, you\u2019ll get it downloaded right away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For podcast enthusiasts \u2013 If you already listen to podcasts and have a podcatcher that you prefer, the feed you\u2019ll need to add is: http:\/\/ amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who don\u2019t have a mobile device \u2013 You can always listen to the show by clicking the audio file at the top of this page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have any queries, just go to www.amazingfba.com\/ask<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Market Research Credit Margins With Anthony Lee &#8211; Part 1<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e22gEJwtlgo&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F_49_Anthony_Lee_Interview_1-auphonic.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F49-amazon-market-research-credit-margins-with-anthony-lee-part-1%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-2\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_49_Anthony_Lee_Interview_1-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=499-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_49_Anthony_Lee_Interview_1-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"_49_Anthony_Lee_Interview_1-auphonic.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 31:31 &#8212; 28.9MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Anthony Lee is the &#8220;anti-guru&#8221; of Amazon selling.
