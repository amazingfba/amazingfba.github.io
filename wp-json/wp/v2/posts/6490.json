Saying that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/2019\/05\/17\/amazon-close-buying-stake-deliveroo\/\"><span class=\"s1\">Jeff Bezos\u2019 e-commerce empire was the lead investor in a giant $575m (\u00a3450m) funding round<\/span><\/a>, taking the total amount of cash raised by the business to $1.53 billion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The announcement of the Amazon Deliveroo investment sent\u00a0shares in rival online food delivery companies such as Just Eat and Takeaway.com falling fast.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>Deliveroo to use Amazon&#8217;s investment for Technology<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">The UK delivery company said it would use the cash injection to \u201cinvest heavily\u201d in its technology. Deliveroo company founder Will Shu claimed he looks forward to working with Amazon,\u00a0 which he described as a \u201ccustomer-obsessed organisation\u201d.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>Amazon\u2019s own Food delivery failures<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">Amazon&#8217;s investment in Deliveroo comes on the back of Amazon pulling back on its own restaurant delivery business in the UK. It closed the London arm of the service in December last year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Amazon shut the doors to its own food delivery business Amazon Restaurants in the UK in 2018 &#8211; after just two years. Amazon Restaurants had struggled in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/2019\/05\/17\/future-holds-food-delivery-firms-like-deliveroo\/\"><span class=\"s1\">highly competitive market dominated by the likes of Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats<\/span><\/a>, all of which deliver food to consumers who make orders through smartphone apps.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>Deliveroo&#8217;s Synergy with Amazon fulfilment<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">The Deliveroo investment may have been driven by the appeal of a network of couriers to Amazon for logistical and staff loyalty reasons.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Delivery staff are usually paid for each completed delivery. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>If Amazon can ensure that the people making their deliveries have little or no downtime,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> then <\/span>delivery staff can make more money and are therefore less likely to go and work for a rival.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">If they are able to transport both goods from Amazon Prime Now, which promises deliveries within two hours, and Deliveroo meals, then the likelihood of downtime is reduced.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>Deliveroo to help Amazon logistics with \u201cDark kitchens\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">Deliveroo&#8217;s push into so-called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-01-15\/deliveroo-takes-a-kitchen-sink-approach-to-food-apps\"><span class=\"s1\">dark kitchens<\/span><\/a>&#8221; might also help with Amazon&#8217;s logistics.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">These are facilities which aren&#8217;t attached to a physical restaurant, often housed in shipping containers on affordable sites dotted around London.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">While the model remains unproven, the idea is to reach more customers without the pricey overheads that come with an actual restaurant. Those locations could also act as last-mile fulfilment centres for Amazon.\u00a0 Deliveroo plans to use many of the proceeds from the latest fundraising to open new sites.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>Political Controversy over Amazon Deliveroo Deal<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">Amazon&#8217;s Deliveroo investment provoked immediate controversy from politician Tom Watson MP, deputy leader of the Labour Party the main Opposition party in the UK. Watson demanded an investigation by the UK\u2019s competition watchdog into Amazon\u2019s ploy to get its \u201cmighty claws\u201d on more consumer data.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cAmazon is obsessed with tracking tools, micro-targeted ads, extracting billions through monetising our personal data,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThey want Deliveroo&#8217;s tech and data\u2026 They want to know how best to extract your cash throughout your waking and sleeping hours.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>Market <\/b><b>Sceptical over Amazon deal with Deliveroo<\/b><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">Market analysts are sceptical of the idea that Amazon&#8217;s Deliveroo deal can succeed in overthrowing Just Eat,\u00a0 which retains a dominant position in the UK food delivery market.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cJust Eat has something like three to four times more of the market share than Deliveroo and Uber Eats combined in the UK,\u201d said Ian Whittaker, research analyst at investment bank Liberum. \u201c60pc of their customers are in small towns,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>where the economics of Uber Eats and Deliveroo just don&#8217;t work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Mr Whittaker added that the Amazon investment appears to be more about the company keeping \u201cin touch with the market.\u201d This feeling was echoed by other market analysts. Broadly, they just\u00a0 don\u2019t believe Amazon will push hard to dominate the food delivery market.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much of the $575m of funding Amazon contributed, but considering it\u2019s got $23bn of cash on its balance sheet, this won\u2019t break the Bezos piggybank,\u201d said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b>UK daily active users of food delivery apps, 2018<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b> Just Eat 499,603<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>Uber eats 50,647<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>Deliveroo 44,890<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">SOURCE: FINANCIAL TIMES<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Faster Prime Shipping Service in the USA Monthly Storage fee discount <\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">Amazon recently announced that in the US they are in the process of evolving their Prime shipping offer. Prime has historically been a two-day program. However,\u00a0 Amazon is aiming to move it to guaranteed one-day shipping in all the Lower 48 states.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The e-commerce giant simply wants customers to get their orders quickly. Amazon said, &#8220;We have found they order more products when there is a one-day delivery promise.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Official Amazon Advice to 3rd party sellers<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cYou can make the most of this &#8230;by provid[ing] enough inventory of your most popular products so that we can place it close to customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">To help sellers get started, Amazon announced a\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/go.amazonsellerservices.com\/e\/229492\/gp-help-GBME4XLGJ54NSKHE\/5pqf6l3\/916536164?h=wePdXory07KF2x-XLvcSPfmGmFtfuj0KGThxLLUSzNM\"><span class=\"s1\">monthly storage fee discount<\/span><\/a> so that sellers could supply more of their most popular products. <b>The promotion begins June 1, 2019, and will run through January 31, 2020.<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">To qualify for reduced fees of up to 75%, suppliers must supply inventory within a target inventory range in a given month.
