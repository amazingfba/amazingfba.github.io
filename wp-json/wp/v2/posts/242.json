Other costs e.g. Amazon Ads etc. are on the Credit Card for cashflow reasons.<\/li>\n<li>He needed about \u00a32000-3000 upfront to order inventory and launch the product<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>AMAZON ADS<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>David turned these on after about 2 weeks and about 20-30 reviews<\/li>\n<li>He ran a manual and auto campaign alongside each other at the start<\/li>\n<li>He put a $20 daily budget to Manual and $10 to Auto<\/li>\n<li>The auto campaign only produced 1-2 sales and those were for a Keyword he knew already was important<\/li>\n<li>He then paused the auto campaign<\/li>\n<li>He launched with bids of about $3 a click to get onto page one with ads while product was on page 14 or so of organic search results<\/li>\n<li>He then gradually reduced the costs per click over time.<\/li>\n<li>ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sales) \u00a0started off over 100%; then it went down to about 65%; last month it was around 45%.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND HOW DAVID OVERCAME THEM<\/p>\n<p>1. Stock management<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>running out of stock happened because he didn\u2019t expect sales to take off so fast<\/li>\n<li>The solution is that he will over-order (now has 1500 units in transit either in China or in the USA) and have 3-4 months worth of stock of his first product so he can focus on buying and launching product no. 2<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>2. Quality issues<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>These weren\u2019t so terrible but there were higher returns than David wanted.<\/li>\n<li>He\u00a0is having\u00a0the returned units shipped to him in the UK<\/li>\n<li>He will then inspect these and then ship some on to China<\/li>\n<li>David uses Viabox to receive returns, which gives a free USA Address. They\u2019ll also store packages for up to 30-60 days and arrange shipping pretty cheaply.<\/li>\n<li>David\u2019s shipping 18 units for $40 (1.6 oz weight\/unit). I make that 1.8 pounds in weight, so that\u2019s about $22 a pound of weight or \u00a314.75\/lb (or about $49 a kg=about \u00a333)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>3. Reseller on his listing<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One of David\u2019s buyers for $1 (giveaway for reviews) listed his product for sale.<\/li>\n<li>David had saved the URLs of the profiles of all of his reviewers<\/li>\n<li>So he was able to track down the reseller and sent them a stern email<\/li>\n<li>The reseller on his listing disappeared!<\/li>\n<li>David had been prepared to just buy the product to get rid of the reseller anyway.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>4. Time management<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the set-up phase, because of doing the Amazon business on top of having a full-time job and a young family, David was having to work evenings and weekends, sometimes 2-3 hours late evenings.<\/li>\n<li>His solution is to commit to the business, and to try to fit in an hour whenever it\u2019s possible, even if that\u2019s 11 pm after a full day of work and family life!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>BEST THINGS ABOUT THE AMAZON FBA BUSINESS MODEL<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can take off very fast<\/li>\n<li>It requires very little input to maintain once set up<\/li>\n<li>The money to be made is very substantial<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>ADVICE FOR NEWCOMERS TO THE BUSINESS<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cJump in and get going!\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t over-analyse. For example, in his first batch of products, David had no inserts and no instructions. He\u2019s just sorted both out for his last (2nd) batch.<\/li>\n<li>If start-up capital is an issue, you can do what David did and use capital for stock but put the recurring costs on a credit card.<\/li>\n<li>Have enough stock to not run out if you can!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS PODCAST<\/p>\n<p>A podcast is a free downloadable audio show that enables you to learn while you\u2019re on the go. \u00a0To subscribe to my podcast for free, you\u2019ll need an app to listen to the show from.<\/p>\n<p>For iPhone\/iPad\/iPod listeners\u00a0\u2013 Grab your phone or device and go to the<a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/improve-photography-podcast\/id575358022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u00a0<\/a>iTunes store and search \u201cAmazing FBA\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This will help you to download the free Podcasts App (produced by Apple) and then subscribe to the show from within that app. \u00a0Every time I produce a new episode, you\u2019ll get it downloaded right on your iDevice.<\/p>\n<p>For Android listeners\u00a0\u2013 Download the Stitcher Radio app (free) and search for \u201cAmazing FBA\u00a0Podcast.\u201d \u00a0Or, if you have already downloaded a podcasting client, follow the directions in the next sentence.<\/p>\n<p>For podcast enthusiasts\u00a0\u2013 If you already listen to podcasts and have a podcatcher that you prefer, the feed you\u2019ll need to add is:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\">http:\/\/\u00a0amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For those who don\u2019t have a mobile device\u00a0\u2013 You can always listen to the show by clicking the audio file at the top of this page.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any queries, just go to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/ask\">www.amazingfba.com\/ask<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon FBA Seller Interview with David Aggiss<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LfrXjCz59Ms&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F19_Interview_with_David_Aggiss_GB_OUTPUT.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F19-amazon-fba-seller-interview-with-david-aggiss%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/19_Interview_with_David_Aggiss_GB_OUTPUT.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=242-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/19_Interview_with_David_Aggiss_GB_OUTPUT.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"19_Interview_with_David_Aggiss_GB_OUTPUT.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 51:22 &#8212; 41.2MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 51:22 &#8212; 41.2MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSThis Episode, #19, \u00a0is a very exciting first for the Podcast: our first interview!
