AKA Total Landed Cost (TLC). Then put that value into the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dutycalculator.com\/\">dutycalculator <\/a>website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Any freight experts here, please feel free to correct and or refine this statement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you are using a Freight Forwarder or even just a Customs broker, obviously ask them how it works and check any nuances for your own product.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Q2: BEN:\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Hi gang! Thanks for your help with my previous question.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Here&#8217;s another one.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">I&#8217;ll shortly be sending my first delivery to Amazon. I haven&#8217;t finished the &#8216;send\/replenish inventory&#8217; section on seller central yet (as I&#8217;m not ready to send yet), but when i am, I presume I&#8217;ll end up on a page that tells me how to organise delivery with one of Amazon&#8217;s preferred carriers?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Otherwise&#8230;the Amazon help pages aren&#8217;t very helpful in detailing how I actually get my stuff from my house to their warehouse! I understand that amazon&#8217;s preferred carriers offer discounts for going to amazon&#8230;which I presume I book through seller central, rather than parceforce.com, for example.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MICHAEL:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Yes that&#8217;s right. Amazon&#8217;s preferred carrier is just the one, UPS. They give Amazon amazing shipping rates. Something like \u00a31 a kg or less. Get a quote at the Post office or from a courier yourself and you&#8217;ll realise how cheap they are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">STUART: Unless, I have missed something but my experience of using Amazon&#8217;s preffered carrier, UPS, only applies when shipping from within a particular country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, rates are fantastic when shipping from UK to FBA in the UK. However, when shipping from UK to FBA in the US, there are no special rates. I have found using Transglobalexpress to be very competitive, and they use UPS as well as other carriers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MICHAEL:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Thanks for the hint, Stuart. May I ask why you&#8217;re shipping UK to US in the first place? Is it sending stock from UK you already have here in order to test the market for that product in the US?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">STUART: That\u2019s correct. I merchant fulfill in UK, and have sent stock to US FBA to test market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Q. 3 BEN:\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Guys, I&#8217;d be interested in your take on this idea. Especially MICHAEL:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>after the last two podcasts\u2026\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">I have heard some stories of people sending off their branding to suppliers to get branded samples, and then when they choose another supplier, the un successful suppliers have gone and made stuff with heir branding and sold it on to other people, or just gone ahead and stuck it on Amazon themselves.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What are your thoughts on getting samples made with &#8216;test&#8217; branding. e.g. my branding with watermarks over the top. That way I can still see the quality of the printing\/branding process and can still see roughly what my branding looks like, but I&#8217;m protected&#8230;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MICHAEL:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>thanks for raising this point. A few thoughts: <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">yes that is a danger. It does happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Firstly, short-term, nobody really cares about your brand yet. So I wouldn&#8217;t over worry about it yet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, I like your idea in that you are testing the quality of printing but protecting your brand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For that matter, if all you want to see is the quality of printing, you could use a different brand altogether! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But The only thing I would say is that by doing this, if you decide to go ahead with a supplier, you probably should get another sample done with your actual logo. Which will delay the process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You could just trust them to do it well and get it done, I guess. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Overall, I&#8217;m basically in favour of your approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, I would say this: I&#8217;m not sure how much back and forth you&#8217;re doing with Suppliers with samples. But it is really important in the PL market now it&#8217;s so crowded to move fast when you spot an opportunity in the market. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SO for speed, I would get my 2-3 samples from suppliers upfront without worrying about branding. Just check out the quality of the product. That should take max 7 days from order to having it in your hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then choose a supplier on the back of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want to then check the quality of the printing of logos etc from your chosen supplier at THAT point, I would then order a proper sample with your real logo. Unless they really mess that up, I&#8217;m going to place an order. If there are minor defects, I&#8217;ll have them correct it and then send me photos of the corrected sample.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then get the order placed and in manufacture<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Please understand: There is nearly ALWAYS a trade off between speed and quality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, it&#8217;s good to have a professional process in place and yes you should protect your brand (reputation) and IP (Intellectual Property). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, if it takes you 6 months to get to market with a good, but not amazing product, which is frankly pretty much the same as everyone else&#8217;s, the competition will often have killed off the profit in that market. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You&#8217;re better off getting your good but not great product to market, learn about the realities of trying to sell, listing optimization, handling Adwords etc etc and get some feedback from customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You may then simply choose<\/span><\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">to abandon that product, if quality is too low or it&#8217;s not profitable OR <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">you could go back to your supplier and customise the product in response to customer<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3, or if quality and sales and profit are all good, just go back and reorder!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Either way, you get MOMENTUM. Do not underestimate the importance of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Money Loves Speed&#8221;. Quality, sadly, does not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">An eternal conundrum. My advice (as a perfectionist): &#8220;The Perfect is the Enemy of the Good&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Good luck .<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">BEN:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thanks for the excellent and in depth response &#8211; it really is appreciated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I have decided that this week I&#8217;ll be sending a &#8216;test&#8217; version of my branding to three suppliers for samples. I expect to get them in 7-10 days, and then I&#8217;ll trust the best one to go ahead with the first full order using the real branding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My &#8216;test&#8217; version is close enough to my &#8216;real&#8217; version that I&#8217;ll know what it looks like from the sample (it&#8217;s basically my branding with a &#8216;test&#8217; watermark over the top, but in such a way that they can&#8217;t remove it&#8217;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MICHAEL: Sounds perfect, good process. I like the thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">BEN: Only issue now is finding the guy who is going to design my packaging&#8230;wink emoticon<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MICHAEL:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>By the way, don&#8217;t assume that the Chinese will care about the watermark. If they spot a product that will sell, they will be interested. Period. Part of doing business in China. Yes protect your IP to a degree, plus make it clear in your paperwork that they are not allowed to use it. But then you&#8217;ve done what you can in practice. Then move on!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Also don\u2019t spend much money on design before you know if the products are worth selling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First check the sample quality before you invest time money or energy in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS PODCAST<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A podcast is a free downloadable audio show that enables you to learn while you\u2019re on the go.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>To subscribe to my podcast for free, you\u2019ll need an app to listen to the show from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For iPhone\/iPad\/iPod listeners \u2013 Grab your phone or device and go to the iTunes store and search \u201cAmazing FBA\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will help you to download the free Podcasts App (produced by Apple) and then subscribe to the show from within that app.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Every time I produce a new episode, you\u2019ll get it downloaded right away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For podcast enthusiasts \u2013 If you already listen to podcasts and have a podcatcher that you prefer, the feed you\u2019ll need to add is: http:\/\/ amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who don\u2019t have a mobile device \u2013 You can always listen to the show by clicking the audio file at the top of this page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have any queries, just go to www.amazingfba.com\/ask<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<h3><strong>Watch Working Out Uk Import Duty Using Amazon Inbound Shipping Q&#038;A Tuesday No. 5<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221;
