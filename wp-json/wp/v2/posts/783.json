For example, during the summer he was getting a lot of review requests for money pouches and passport holders that you would use when you travel. As we get closer to Christmas he will likely start getting a lot of requests for lights and other holiday items. Keep this in mind if you have seasonal items.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, let\u2019s say you are going to sell neck pouches for traveling. You know the summer is going to be the busy time for travel so you want to plan ahead and start getting reviews in spring or even winter. You want to get ahead of the competition.<\/p>\n<p>If you wait until June, the reviews will have received several requests for similar items and may not want any more. Also, reviews may take a couple weeks for the reviewer to get around to it. If you wait until June, it might be in July when the review comes in. At that point, you have already missed a good portion of the traveling season. As a bonus, if you get your reviews early, you are prepared for customers to start looking to buy these items. <a href=\"https:\/\/europeanprivatelabelsummit.com\/via\/AmazingFBA\/\">Click here for more information on the European summit<\/a> if you are looking for tips on breaking into the European market.<\/p>\n<p>Other items he gets requested a lot include\u00a0flashlights, bike lights, headphones (bluetooth and wired), LED lamps, garden lamps, solar\/ battery powered lamps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Amazon has banned the use of super URLs, have you had any issue with this?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>(A super URL is the address Amazon uses when you search for items and listings get ranked higher based on the keywords people search for. There are tools that will mimic this super URL and makes Amazon think people are finding your product based on keywords that they didn\u2019t search for and thus these products get listed higher.)<\/p>\n<p>Augustas hasn\u2019t seen much of this lately. It used to be that the requests would give instructions directing you to go to amazon.de\/keyword and it will be the third item down. This would build your ranking for that keyword but it was very inconvenient for the reviewer and often Augustas would ignore the instructions and simply locate it by the ASIN. He doesn\u2019t get these much anymore and there is even a service that will mimic that URL so you don\u2019t need to go through all that. However, be warned that Amazon is cracking down on the tactic and has even started removing listings.<\/p>\n<p>A tip from Augustas for sellers that do fulfilled by merchant rather than FBA. If you have a good relationship with a reviewer, you can use them to make sure your staff or external warehouse is doing a good job. Augustas had a seller that had his own shop and staff that packaged everything. Augustas would give him feedback on the packaging and ways to improve it or if something was missing. It\u2019s a good way to test for quality assurance. It\u2019s better to get private feedback from a reviewer rather than a very public negative comment from a customer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How important do you think reviews are in general for listing conversion?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some people may not believe a review is genuine. As a reviewer, it might be difficult to leave a bad review if you have a good relationship with the seller. So rather than giving a 4-star review, you may give 5 because of the customer service.<\/p>\n<p>As a customer, Augustas will always compare reviews especially if one doesn\u2019t seem genuine. And if he sees a short review from a customer that hasn\u2019t left many other reviews, it will hold more weight because it\u2019s a casual shopper that wanted to leave their experience rather than a top reviewer. He noticed on one particular item that he was giving 2 or three stars and the reason why, and he saw the rest of the reviews were all 5-star reviews from top reviewers because they were getting free stuff.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think, as a shopper, that <\/strong>the quantity of<strong> reviews is important for conversion? Or is quality more important?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Augustas will look for 2 or 3 quality reviews. If it\u2019s just 2 or 3 lines he will often skip it and look for someone that wrote a couple paragraphs. If he sees that the person got the product for free in exchange for a review then he will look for another one and compare. But definitely, he wants to see a few quality reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Augustas was looking at another product some time back and noticed they were getting close to 50 reviews a day. However, they are said they got the product for free. This went on for a while, around 50 reviews a day and they had around 1000. About 6 months later he went back looked and found that they almost completely stopped getting reviews. They might have gotten another 50 organic reviews which showed that they might not be getting many sales. They invested a lot to get all those reviews but that didn\u2019t translate into actual sales because they weren\u2019t quality reviews.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As a buyer, how important is the quantity? Are you looking for 100 reviews or are you happy with 5 as long as they are long quality reviews?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A few good reviews are great. If he can get a good idea about the product from a few well-written reviews then it doesn\u2019t matter if there are 50 more reviews.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/europeanprivatelabelsummit.com\/via\/AmazingFBA\/\">For more info on the European Private Label Summit, click here<\/a>\u00a0where you can learn other tips for succeeding in the European Amazon marketplaces.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What about photos and videos? Do you think they make a big difference to the impact of a review?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Oh yes. Since sellers cannot upload their own videos they really like it when the reviewer does one. Some sellers have approached Augustas about reviewing their products because they saw the videos he did.<\/p>\n<p>Now Augustas will upload about 10 photos and a video for each review he does, and as a buyer, it holds more weight than what the seller uploads because it is an actual customer\u2019s unboxing rather that the photoshopped images the seller is putting out. Depending on the product, in his video, he will show how the product is used. This could be particularly beneficial if it can be complicated. This way buyers can watch how it\u2019s done rather than be dissatisfied with your product.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does it make a difference to Amazon if you have a lot of top-reviewer reviews?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Probably not. It\u2019s unlikely that Amazon would weigh top reviews more than regular reviewers. In fact, Amazon doesn\u2019t really like these free reviews. He did an interview with a private seller that used to work in Amazon and according to him Amazon is all about the customers, and when reviews are getting free products then they are losing the true connection between the product and the customer. It may be, that in the future, it will be more difficult for this type of reviewer to exist.<\/p>\n<p>Even as sellers, we know that these reviews aren\u2019t completely genuine. It\u2019s different than when as a customer, you buy a product, you really like it, and decide to go and leave a review. It\u2019s likely that Amazon will make it more difficult and in fact, in the US, they are starting to require that sellers can only give a 50% discount for reviews.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about the private label online summit<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Augustas wanted to start his own private label business but it ended up not working out and he got into reviews. He noticed that people often had a lot of questions about Europe and there wasn\u2019t one place you could go for consolidated information about getting reviews in Europe, different languages, taxes, and many other topics. Augustas decided to help out by gathering experts about all these different topics. He has about 20 speakers that will be sharing their knowledge. He has some sellers from the US so you can hear their stories and follow their paths. There is a lawyer from Germany that will discuss some of the laws and regulations you have to follow, especially in Germany where they are a bit stricter.<\/p>\n<p>He decided to go with a virtual format because it\u2019s easier to set it up, it easier for the speakers to be there, and it\u2019s easier for the audience to be able to get all the information.<\/p>\n<p>If you have had any desire to sell in Germany, this is a great resource to learn what you need to know. If you\u2019re a UK based seller, you can still be based out of the UK and sell in Germany. Your orders will be fulfilled by the UK warehouse. If you are in the US, don\u2019t let the language barrier stop you, it\u2019s not that difficult to work around.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/europeanprivatelabelsummit.com\/via\/AmazingFBA\/\">Click here for more information on the European Summit<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any websites\/events\/places that people can learn more from you or contact you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/augustaskligys.com\/\">agustaskligys.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/europeanprivatelabelsummit.com\/via\/AmazingFBA\/\">European Private Label Summit<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Any parting words of wisdom?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Treat you reviewers like your customers.
