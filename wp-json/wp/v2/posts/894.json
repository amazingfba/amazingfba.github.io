Not good photos, not the best you can do, but great photography. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best that you can possibly get. If you look at AirB<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nB for example, one of the decisions they made early on was to send professional photographers to the homes to take photos. In the beginning, people weren\u2019t booking because the photos weren\u2019t good enough. As soon as they started offering that to the AirBnB hosts, their business took off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another flaw in the course gurus is that they sold Amazon short. They said you can come in with $1000 and be making $30,000 a month in six months and that\u2019s just not true. What Adam tells people is that is you can start with $5,000 and in the first year you can rotate that money at 30% margin in a year, that\u2019s a win.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/online.reliable.education\/free-amazon-training-course1?affiliate_id=516769&amp;aff_sub=Show%20notes%20(blog)&amp;aff_sub2=Facebook%20Group&amp;nopopup=false&amp;noautoplay=false\">CLICK HERE<\/a> for more details on Adam&#8217;s approach to Amazon on his &#8220;Reliable Education&#8221; site.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren Buffett is the greatest investor in the world and one of the richest men in the world. If you look at his record he is trading at 20% a year. If you\u2019re doing it at 30% then you\u2019re doing better than Warren Buffett. As you get better you\u2019ll be able to rotate that twice in a year then you\u2019re doing 60%. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you sit down with a compounding calculator and do the math on if you start with $5,000 or $10,000 you can see that you have an amazing vehicle at your disposal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, a lot of these \u201cgurus\u201d are telling people they\u2019re failures if you\u2019re not making $20,000 or $30,000 a month in your first year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned that you started with 6 products and turned that into a million dollars a year, so I would assume that you put substantial capital into that.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, it&#8217;s at $1,000,000 a year &#8220;run rate&#8221;, ie, it now turns over about $83,000 a month. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam figures that he started that business with about $60,000. This was a different company. He has a completely different brand that he\u2019s been running for about three years and he started that one with $20,000. At this point, he hasn\u2019t taken any money from it. Except for a $20,000 loan from Amazon that he accepted just to see what it was about, he has been compounding that initial capital. Right now he has hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory paid for in distribution center around the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>The only other person I\u2019ve talked to about compounding your money is Will Tjernlund. If you took that $60,000 and after a year turned it into $80,000 a month that clearly is a tremendous success. How on earth did you manage that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam is experienced at this point, with his numerous business adventures, and experience comes from activity and time and anybody can learn to do that if you stick with it (<a href=\"https:\/\/online.reliable.education\/free-amazon-training-course1?affiliate_id=516769&amp;aff_sub=Show%20notes%20(blog)&amp;aff_sub2=Facebook%20Group&amp;nopopup=false&amp;noautoplay=false\">learn more from Adam here<\/a>\u00a0at Reliable Education)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference, according to Adam, is that Will farms a product. He\u2019ll throw 20 or 30 products out there and two or three will be a hit. He clears the rest out and starts over. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam wanted to build a brand with a small number of products. He currently has six products with an average cost of $8 and retails for $40 with one about $129. Adam\u2019s strategy is to build his brand around a few products and get them to page one and keep them there. Last time he checked, Will had around 1700 SKUs. He didn\u2019t want to think about what that was like, to wake up and have to monitor 1700 SKUs. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_19\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=19\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you find potential products? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be successful, it\u2019s about paying attention to the details and being objective. If you look at AirBnB and everything that makes it successful, then reverse engineer that and unpack it to find every component, that kinda what you have to do with Amazon. For example, AirBnB hired pro photographers to go every single place listed on the site!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Too many sellers go in with the wrong mentality. They go in think they need to make this product in this price range and that\u2019s all wrong because you\u2019re building a product around your limitations and needs rather than the wants and the desires of the customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam as two or three products that are on page one for the biggest term they\u2019re on. Now, the top couple spots are taken up by his products and he sells them two in a box while his competitors sell it four or six to a box. His product is $40, the next person is $20, and everyone else is cheaper than that. He is at least twice as much as his competitors and is selling half as many.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For more details, <a href=\"https:\/\/online.reliable.education\/free-amazon-training-course1?affiliate_id=516769&amp;aff_sub=Show%20notes%20(blog)&amp;aff_sub2=Facebook%20Group&amp;nopopup=false&amp;noautoplay=false\">CLICK HERE<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>This almost mirrors Kevin King in regards to the ideas behind the photos and going against conventional wisdom. How did you find these products in the first place?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people will misunderstand what he is saying, and you can find out more in his course at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/online.reliable.education\/free-amazon-training-course1?affiliate_id=516769&amp;aff_sub=Show%20notes%20(blog)&amp;aff_sub2=Facebook%20Group&amp;nopopup=false&amp;noautoplay=false\">reliable.education<\/a>. They think they just need to charge more. However, you must have a clear reason that a customer will give you more money. It\u2019s more than headlines or you saying it\u2019s better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these products are bought as a gift. The person is intending to gift the item to someone. Like with a ring from Tiffany\u2019s, you paying for the box as much as you are the ring. So every aspect needs to be thought about. Don\u2019t get on Fiverr and pay someone $15 for a logo. His philosophy is pay once for the best. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write amazing briefs for everything from accounts to designers. Articulate exactly what you expect from them. If you hire a designer, the work is only going to be as good as the brief you give them. If you spend a little extra on the packaging, you can really impress your customers and all this goes to building a brand.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sellers\u00a0make the wrong assumption that no one has money and are looking for the cheapest product and that\u2019s just incorrect. Now, this doesn\u2019t apply to all products, not all products need to go to the extent, but at least make sure your logo is top notch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>(To get more training from Adam, go to <a href=\"https:\/\/online.reliable.education\/free-amazon-training-course1?affiliate_id=516769&amp;aff_sub=Show%20notes%20(blog)&amp;aff_sub2=Facebook%20Group&amp;nopopup=false&amp;noautoplay=false\">reliable.education<\/a>\u00a0)<\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_19\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=19\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Adam Hudson on Amazon Basics Pt. 2<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XVesJ7Oh5Vo&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F100_Adam_Hudson_on_Amazon_Basics_Pt._2.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F98-adam-hudson-on-amazon-basics-pt-2%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/100_Adam_Hudson_on_Amazon_Basics_Pt._2.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=894-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/100_Adam_Hudson_on_Amazon_Basics_Pt._2.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"100_Adam_Hudson_on_Amazon_Basics_Pt._2.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 16:47 &#8212; 13.8MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 16:47 &#8212; 13.8MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSS Get Adam&#8217;s Latest thoughts HERE So, the first thing is to have a great product, what\u2019s the next thing?
