That turns out to be a <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8kmqs-1-0\">surprisingly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8kmqs-2-0\"> tricky process.&#8221; <\/span>William Poundstone<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"t-1657146510613\"><span data-offset-key=\"7ci5k-0-0\"><a id=\"why-pricing\"><\/a>Why Pricing Strategy Matters in e-commerce<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"f2jl0-0-0\">So let&#8217;s talk about this. First of all, why does this even matter? <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"130p3-0-0\">More than ever, e-commerce entrepreneurs have had crazy rises in costs. Whether it&#8217;s shipping or raw material costs, they have shot up. Amazon ads costs have also gone up across the board. At least 50% year-on-year increase in Amazon ad costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"36sl3-0-0\">Focussing on Amazon pricing and how it drives profits, the maths is pretty simple. Let&#8217;s come back to more mundane math that we can all grasp, but overlook, which is this:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"77rb5-0-0\">If you have a $20 product, which has say a 20% profit margin, that means if you&#8217;re good at math, you are making $4 in profits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"iqng-0-0\">Let&#8217;s say you increase the price by 10%. Let&#8217;s say also you can maintain that price and keep your other costs the same. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"iqng-0-0\">Well, guess what? Your profit has increased from four to $6. Yes, that isn&#8217;t a dramatic amount in absolute terms. But, it&#8217;s a 50% increase in profit for a mere 10% increase in price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"t-1657145517353\" data-offset-key=\"1vfgs-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"1vfgs-0-0\"><a id=\"can-i\"><\/a>Can I just increase my price on Amazon? <\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"e4pi2-0-0\">Now, can you <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"e4pi2-1-0\">just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"e4pi2-2-0\"> increase your price by 10%? Well, that&#8217;s an interesting question. Isn&#8217;t it? <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"fberp-0-0\">In some cases, the answer is &#8211; yes, more than you might think! In those cases, this maths has got huge power. It goes straight to your gross profit line. Not only is it not abstract, but it&#8217;s not a casual matter. This drives huge amounts of profit if you get it right. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a subject worthy of serious consideration. And of intense action. <\/span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2-e1657142307594-1024x576.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"t-1657145517354\" data-offset-key=\"bgcg6-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"bgcg6-0-0\"><a id=\"price-sens\"><\/a>Price Sensitivity &#8211; a key part of Amazon Pricing Strategy <\/span><\/h2>\n<h4 data-offset-key=\"bgcg6-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"bgcg6-0-0\">(it&#8217;s not <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bgcg6-0-1\">always<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bgcg6-0-2\"> what you think!)<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"9n2eq-0-0\">So one concept I want to talk about is price sensitivity. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"9n2eq-1-0\">We all as sellers tend to assume that all products are very price-sensitive on Amazon. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"9n2eq-2-0\"> At least most people I&#8217;ve ever worked with or spoken with. Back in the day myself, I&#8217;ve done that as well.<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2l7s0-0-0\">But in the 10 K collective mastermind, we&#8217;ve found a different reality on the ground. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"t-1657145517356\" data-offset-key=\"fmbmi-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"fmbmi-0-0\">3 product categories of price sensitivity<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"8ubbc-0-0\">Learning how price sensitive your products are is a critical piece of your Amazon pricing strategy. But it&#8217;s a bit more subtle than that. From the mastermind, it seems that three categories have emerged of price sensitivity on Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"e2l1s-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"e2l1s-0-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/1-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>1. Price-sensitive products<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"2ln6h-0-0\">First of all, some products <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2ln6h-1-0\">are indeed<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2ln6h-2-0\"> quite price sensitive. So if you raise your price and the competitors keep theirs, then you find that the sales drop off. And if you raise your price a lot, they drop off a great deal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"42r7-0-0\">Sometimes it&#8217;s caused by the competitors lowering their prices. Sometimes that kicks off a price war. Of course, we&#8217;re all <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"42r7-1-0\">incredibly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"42r7-2-0\"> familiar with that. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"42r7-3-0\">However<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"42r7-4-0\">, there are new forces coming into play now. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"e69k-0-0\">Sometimes you and the competition might keep prices the same but still see price sensitivity<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"e69k-1-0\">. Consumers become more price-sensitive because they feel under financial pressure. That&#8217;s a very strong trend and set to continue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"7u5st-0-0\">For the foreseeable future in mid-2022, they will be feeling the effects of inflation. Who knows what comes next? We already have inflation. A recession may well be to come, <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7u5st-1-0\">probably<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7u5st-2-0\"> with rising unemployment to follow. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7u5st-3-0\">All of<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7u5st-4-0\"> these reduce consumers&#8217; purchasing power. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"39f8i-0-0\">So with all that at play, that sounds like the mundane boring and rather depressing reality of the normal price sensitivity<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"39f8i-1-0\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"fnjah-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"fnjah-0-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>2. Price insensitive products<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"6hg7-0-0\">However<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6hg7-1-0\">, some of the more savvy members of the mastermind have discovered some products are quite price insensitive<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6hg7-2-0\">. That is to say, you can raise the price quite a significant amount before demand drops. That&#8217;s a dramatically powerful discovery! And thus a key part of Amazon pricing strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"6hg7-3-0\">So you raise your price by 10% and you <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6hg7-4-0\">maybe<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6hg7-5-0\"> increase your profits anywhere, depending on your profit margin From 30% to 50 per cent or more<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6hg7-6-0\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"ddgt6-0-0\">One of the mastermind members that sells a lot of products has got a good business, but they have pretty thin margins on the individual products<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ddgt6-1-0\">. If are looking at a product that sells for 10 pounds and you make one pound profit. Guess what? If you can increase your price by 10%, that extra pound <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ddgt6-1-1\">doubles<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ddgt6-1-2\"> the profit.<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2gpqg-0-0\">So the thinner your margins are, the more significant it is to find those products that are price elastic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"42hh1-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"42hh1-0-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/3-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>3. Prices can <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"42hh1-1-0\">be raised<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"42hh1-2-0\"> but branding work <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"42hh1-3-0\">is needed<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"42hh1-4-0\"> to do so<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"547r7-0-0\">The third category is more common. Those are the products whose prices you can raise, but which will need some extra marking work to justify it. And sometimes you will need to tweak the product mix as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 id=\"t-1657145517360\" data-offset-key=\"d6q4k-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"d6q4k-0-0\">Changing the product and packaging<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"8fe64-0-0\">Now there are lots and lots of clever things that the price consultants out there at SKP <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8fe64-1-0\">advise<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8fe64-2-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8fe64-3-0\">For example, you may have noticed the shrinking size of packets of some consumer products over the years<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8fe64-4-0\">. Products keep the same price but get <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8fe64-5-0\">gradually<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8fe64-6-0\"> smaller or lower in quantity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"2sfiq-0-0\">Let&#8217;s say you have a hundred-gram bar of chocolate that cost a Euro, and now it&#8217;s 90 grams but it still costs a Euro. Say 3 ounces and a dollar if you prefer American measurements. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"areb6-0-0\">I&#8217;m not suggesting that as an easy win. It&#8217;s one thing you can consider of course. But that means rejigging your physical products, your packaging. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"areb6-1-0\"> So I&#8217;m going to stick with this series of profit maximization videos and podcasts and content to the basics<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"areb6-2-0\">. This means you don&#8217;t have to change the actual products very much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"t-1657146510618\" data-offset-key=\"9bf77-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"9bf77-0-0\">How do we <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"9bf77-1-0\">implement<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"9bf77-2-0\"> this &#8211; practical Amazon pricing strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"e2uo1-0-0\">Now we are getting into the world of practical Amazon pricing tactics. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"e2uo1-1-0\">So how do we actually exploit this theoretical ability to explore pricing to maximize profit<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"e2uo1-2-0\">?

In some cases, there won&#8217;t be enough profit margin to do any kind of discount. In those cases don&#8217;t use this tactic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"9acnh-0-0\">But for some people this tactic can be very powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"t-1657146510622\" data-offset-key=\"7qmdn-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"7qmdn-0-0\">The third thing is bundling.<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"1o24v-0-0\">Lots of things you can do with that. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1o24v-1-0\">But <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1o24v-2-0\">broadly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1o24v-3-0\"> speaking, if people will buy one unit and they might buy two units, then they&#8217;re quite like to be in the market for four units<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1o24v-4-0\">. What about 10? What about 20?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"60t3g-0-0\">Getting the amounts right is a thing you&#8217;ll need to find out by experiment. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"60t3g-1-0\">So <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"60t3g-2-0\">I suggest<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"60t3g-3-0\"> you bundle them at home or use the third-party warehouse or your own warehouse stuff, depending on the size of your operation<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"60t3g-4-0\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"9plg9-0-0\">I don&#8217;t suggest<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"9plg9-1-0\"> that you hard wire it in don&#8217;t get it done in the factory in China for now. That&#8217;s not the way to experiment with bundling sizing, in my view. You can do that once you know what sells and what the sales velocity is. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"t-1657146510623\" data-offset-key=\"3lm25-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"3lm25-0-0\">The fourth is: loss leaders<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"ebjh1-0-0\">This is about getting a small version or a cheaper version or less quantity<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ebjh1-1-0\">.

Bear with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"8jutf-0-0\"> I&#8217;ve <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8jutf-1-0\">just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8jutf-2-0\"> explained how complex the psychology of all this stuff can be. And now we&#8217;re <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8jutf-3-0\">suddenly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8jutf-4-0\"> talking about outsourcing it to a mere machine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"2l6ms-0-0\">Well, there are machines and machines. Rules-basedRules based systems <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2l6ms-1-0\">are indeed<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2l6ms-2-0\"> a bit primitive for this situation. But an artificial intelligence engine can be powerful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"2b9qj-0-0\">The best people I know for this are the guys at <a href=\"https:\/\/eva.guru\/solutions\/private-label-pricing\/?fpr=michael81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eva<\/a>. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2b9qj-1-0\">I believe<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2b9qj-2-0\"> they are the only people who <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2b9qj-3-0\">really<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2b9qj-4-0\"> deal with private label situations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"ctlhu-0-0\">If you <a href=\"https:\/\/eva.guru\/solutions\/private-label-pricing\/?fpr=michael81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">head over to Eva using this link<\/a>, you will see my coupon code over there, and I&#8217;m happy to get you a large discount on your first month&#8217;s subscription.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"all4u-0-0\">But that is <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"all4u-1-0\">really<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"all4u-2-0\"> the only with the right tool that repricing that it is an easy win.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"b9sqm-0-0\">Manual repricing, repricing by hand, is <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"b9sqm-1-0\">probably<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"b9sqm-2-0\"> the<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"b9sqm-2-1\"> hardest<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"b9sqm-2-2\"> of the repricing tactics the mastermind members use<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"b9sqm-3-0\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"6k43v-0-0\"> Both approaches to repricing, by the way, <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6k43v-1-0\">are used<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6k43v-2-0\"> in the mastermind. Some people have <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6k43v-3-0\">manually<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6k43v-4-0\"> repriced using a member of staff full-time. In some cases, other people have used a repricing engine like Eva and are getting strong results with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"b96ci-0-0\">So that&#8217;s the first thing is using a re-pricing engine of the right kind. And that&#8217;s such a big area that I&#8217;m going to devote a whole podcast to re-pricing. It&#8217;s a powerful pricing tactic, but you need to do it the right way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In fact, using automation the right way is a key part of Amazon pricing strategy in general.<\/p>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"1br6l-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"1br6l-0-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/5-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"1br6l-0-0\"><\/h3>\n<h3 id=\"t-1657146510628\" data-offset-key=\"1br6l-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"1br6l-0-0\">Tactic 2: Tiered coupon codes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"1949b-0-0\">The second tactic then that&#8217;s pretty straightforward is <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1949b-1-0\">really<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1949b-2-0\"> very easy one. That is: tiering coupon codes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"bm0mg-0-0\">We all know about the ability to create general-use coupon codes or one-time use code. So I&#8217;m talking about general use codes on Amazon that are out there. We are not talking about one-time codes (individual codes) so often used for product launches. Instead, I mean promo codes ones that are out there all the time on your listing. Codes that are available to the general public. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"4ep86-0-0\">The tiered system is something most sellers don&#8217;t know about or don&#8217;t use. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"cdc1g-0-0\">But if you&#8217;ve got certain types of products that lend themselves to <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"cdc1g-1-0\">being bought<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"cdc1g-2-0\"> in bulk, it can be a powerful way to drive unit sales<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"cdc1g-3-0\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"t-1657146510629\" data-offset-key=\"cdc1g-0-0\">The simple pricing tactic to double sales<\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"lb9l-0-0\">The fantastic news? <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"lb9l-1-0\">You can sell the products at least in multiples, then even without bothering to bundle your products into packaging<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"lb9l-2-0\">. Together, you can still sell 10 units, 20 or 50 units, whatever, add a discount in one order. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"5qc4m-0-0\">And I&#8217;ve done this a lot in the past, used to sell products to choirs and orchestras. Being institutions and groups, they would <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"5qc4m-1-0\">happily<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"5qc4m-2-0\"> buy products in bulk. They used to buy by the tens, the twenties, thirties, fifties, and even hundreds when I gave them a nice discount. And I <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"5qc4m-3-0\">just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"5qc4m-4-0\"> used the Amazon tiered coupon system. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"eshse-0-0\">But Michael, I hear you saying. If you are talking about profit maximization, why are we discussing discounts? <\/span>Well, another key part of Amazon pricing strategy is to differentiate between profit per unit, profit per order and profit per month.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"63ukq-0-0\">For starters, you don&#8217;t have to give a big discount. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"63ukq-1-0\">If you give a 10% discount for ordering 20 of a product, although your profit per unit is going to be lower, your profit per order is much, much higher<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"63ukq-2-0\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"nsdl-0-0\">Especially if you&#8217;re paying for traffic, it is <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"nsdl-1-0\">potentially<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"nsdl-2-0\"> much more profitable. Because you pay per click and if one click converts, you&#8217;re selling say 20 units at a go rather than one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"c2i86-0-0\">So if you&#8217;re selling units, somebody for $20 each and you discount 10% say to $16 then you. Sell 20 units and you&#8217;re looking at a much higher revenue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"fmusj-0-0\">Now, of course, this only works if you don&#8217;t discount too hard and remove your profit margin. And you need reasonable profit margins there to start with. So you&#8217;ve got to tailor it according to your own situation. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"fmusj-0-0\">But that can drive a lot more in absolute profits, even if the percentage of profits is a bit lower per unit. And if you&#8217;ve got a lot of stock, you want to move through at the same time, that can be a powerful combination. Better profits AND better cash flow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"1ldi3-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"1ldi3-0-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/6-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"1ldi3-0-0\"><\/h3>\n<h3 id=\"t-1657146510632\" data-offset-key=\"1ldi3-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"1ldi3-0-0\">Tactic 3: Bundling<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"2jo2e-0-0\">Now, the next pricing tactic I&#8217;m going to talk about should drive all types of profit. The absolute profit, the relative profits and the absolute profits. That tactic is bundling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"87jdb-0-0\">This is an obvious thing to do as well. But many people don&#8217;t do the obvious. And I&#8217;m here to tell you that the people in the mastermind who&#8217;ve done it have great success with this. It&#8217;s <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"87jdb-1-0\">been done<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"87jdb-2-0\"> at some scale now, and in many different product areas. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"2r31d-0-0\">Just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2r31d-1-0\"> because it&#8217;s obvious doesn&#8217;t mean everyone&#8217;s doing it. And if your competitors are doing it and you are not, then you&#8217;re handing the competition a stick to beat you with. So use it yourself instead. And if your competition isn&#8217;t using bundling <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2r31d-2-0\">properly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2r31d-3-0\">, then it&#8217;s there for the taking for you!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, many sellers use bundling as part of their Amazon pricing strategy but they don&#8217;t realise how far they can go with it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"7qn6e-0-0\">So bundling is very simple but you shouldn&#8217;t overlook its power. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7qn6e-1-0\">The difference between that and the tiered coupon codes approach that I&#8217;ve <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7qn6e-2-0\">just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7qn6e-3-0\"> suggested is simple<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7qn6e-4-0\">. You put all the products into packaging together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"7qn6e-5-0\">So you could have individual units of something selling and you can create a two-pack, a three-pack, or five-pack of the same kinds of things<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7qn6e-6-0\">.<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7qn6e-6-0\"> If you sell a bundle of varied things, you can bundle the things together in bigger or smaller bundles as well. For example, you sell a shoe cleaning kit with a brush, black shoe polish and a shoe polishing cloth. In which case, you can experiment with adding brown polish, spare shoe laces, or a little shoe bag, for example. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"5o6fo-0-0\">It&#8217;s not rocket science to do this. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"5o6fo-1-0\">If you send the stock to Amazon from your home or from a third-party warehouse, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward to do<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"5o6fo-2-0\">. If it goes direct from say China or from your factory somewhere else, you are going to need to get your factory to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 data-offset-key=\"5o6fo-0-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/7.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>How to start experimenting with Bundling<\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"3hgku-0-0\">So my advice is very simple: start your bundling experiments with very small numbers. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3hgku-1-0\">So if you have <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3hgku-2-0\">normally<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3hgku-3-0\"> individual units and you&#8217;ve got them in a third-party warehouse somewhere, you&#8217;re in good shape<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3hgku-4-0\">. Get them to bundle together two of the units into one package.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"3hgku-4-0\"> Yes, you may need to use some temporary packaging until you&#8217;ve got things scaled. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3hgku-5-0\">I wouldn&#8217;t suggest scaling and committing to new packaging until you have data showing that it&#8217;s going to work well<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3hgku-6-0\">. And at that point, you can go away and get bigger packaging made etcetera.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"emgu5-0-0\">Anything could become complex if you work that way! But I would start with the simplest possible version.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-0-0\">If you <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-1-0\">literally<\/span> <span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-3-0\">just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-4-0\"> take two cardboard <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-5-0\">basically<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-6-0\"> cubes of product two units in each package, for example, you could wrap the two together<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-7-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-8-0\">Just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-9-0\"> make sure that you&#8217;ve obeyed Amazon&#8217;s instructions about packaging. Again, it&#8217;s not complex. And it&#8217;s <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-10-0\">really<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7kqti-11-0\"> worth doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"1881u-0-0\">One important thing about the psychology of pricing is simple. A lot of people aren&#8217;t very good at doing the maths! So if everyone else is bundling, say two units, four units, eight units, then why don&#8217;t you bundle nine or 12? It&#8217;s harder for people to do the maths. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"69k4m-0-0\">A majority of people won&#8217;t be doing the maths that <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"69k4m-1-0\">vigorously<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"69k4m-2-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"69k4m-3-0\">It depends on how price sensitive your market is and different categories will vary on that front<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"69k4m-4-0\">. The key thing is to avoid direct comparisons. Avoid being apples compared with apples!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"7itv4-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"7itv4-0-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/8.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 data-offset-key=\"7itv4-0-0\"><\/h3>\n<h3 id=\"t-1657146510636\" data-offset-key=\"7itv4-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"7itv4-0-0\">Tactic 4: Loss Leaders<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"7k4de-0-0\">The next pricing tactic is pricing related. That is: loss leaders of small bundles or small sizes, depending on the type of product you&#8217;ve got.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Again, this demands a more sophisticated approach to Amazon pricing strategy than merely maximising profit on every unit sold. But done right, this can be a great way to grow profits AND grow your market share. Aka stealing sales from your competitors!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"ftufa-0-0\">One of our mastermind members has been very successful with this. He&#8217;s pushed into it by one of his competitors. He and his business partner responded by producing a small version of their product. They hoped it would be a loss leader.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"7i6cs-0-0\">Specifically<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7i6cs-1-0\">, they hoped consumers would click on the listing when they saw it because it was cheap<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7i6cs-2-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7i6cs-3-0\">Therefore<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7i6cs-4-0\">, it would sell a lot and thus it would rank high in search results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"4i8vl-0-0\">They set their listing up as a parent and child relationship. So consumers who clicked on the small variation would see their other variations. Those variations have a bigger size and an even bigger size of the products &#8211; and thus higher price points. And then, my member hoped, consumers would buy the higher-priced items. Thus driving profits. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"ffvnr-0-0\">I&#8217;m delighted to say that has all happened according to plan! <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ffvnr-1-0\">But even better, they&#8217;ve discovered that they&#8217;re actually making a profit &#8211; albeit a small one &#8211; on the small size as well, because it&#8217;s selling so <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ffvnr-2-0\">easily<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ffvnr-3-0\">. So going in with a loss leader has proven to be a very successful pricing tactic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"b5imv-0-0\">The product I mentioned is very much a luxury product but it still works. In price-sensitive times, consumers still want a little bit of luxury. They <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"b5imv-1-0\">just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"b5imv-2-0\"> don&#8217;t feel they can justify what they used to spend. This tactic can help them and you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"t-1657146510637\" data-offset-key=\"b5imv-0-0\">Loss leader pricing tactics in action<\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"654j4-0-0\">Say they used to spend $25 on a luxury product. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"654j4-1-0\">Maybe<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"654j4-2-0\"> they need to spend 15 now. And if you engineer it <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"654j4-3-0\">correctly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"654j4-4-0\">, then you can <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"654j4-5-0\">probably<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"654j4-6-0\"> make a profit on the front end. But even if you don&#8217;t, you should make a profit from the parent listing as a whole (that is to say the group of variations). <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"3lmmn-0-0\">The key to profiting is to have the more expensive products priced <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3lmmn-1-0\">correctly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3lmmn-2-0\">. On the one hand, they need to be profitable for you. On the other, you need to price them against the small size to look like better value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"5i2vh-0-0\">Say your small version of the product is $15. If you offer a 10 pack, then it&#8217;s <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"5i2vh-1-0\">proportionately<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"5i2vh-2-0\"> a lot less per item at $99, for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"a4c2l-0-0\">This is great news for the coming downturn or recession. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"jg9t-0-0\">You can <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"jg9t-1-0\">probably<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"jg9t-2-0\"> still inhabit the affordable luxury position using this pricing tactic. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"jg9t-3-0\">That&#8217;s great because it&#8217;s much more profitable positioning than bargain or value for money <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"jg9t-4-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"jg9t-5-0\">Just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"jg9t-6-0\"> be smart about thinking about sizing and amounts of products.

And that implies the pricing stays the same and the number of sales goes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"3tsnt-0-0\">But with an improved conversion rate and a more powerful brand you can focus on defending your price instead<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3tsnt-1-0\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"1v868-0-0\">Let&#8217;s say you currently have 10 people out of every hundred visitors buy your product at $20. That&#8217;s a 10% conversion rate. Yes, you can work on your listing to have say 15 out of 100 visitors convert at a $20 price. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"1v868-0-0\">But you can also choose to have 10 people out of a hundred convert, but at a<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1v868-0-1\"> $23<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3bevg-0-0\"> price. The latter explodes your profit per order and especially per unit. That is fantastic news for your gross margin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"a9fd3-0-0\">So conversion rate optimization should become an obsession. It&#8217;s always a nice to have. Now it&#8217;s an <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"a9fd3-1-0\">absolutely<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"a9fd3-2-0\"> essential to have in the straitened times we live in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"8rgkq-0-0\">We&#8217;ll be more specific when it comes to the branding-specific episode in this series.

You need to tell people what they&#8217;re going to get from using your product. It&#8217;s particularly true in the US and similar in the UK. It&#8217;s not how you should sell to Germans. They like features. They&#8217;re very <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"frebv-1-0\">technically<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"frebv-2-0\"> minded, &#8211; it&#8217;s a different world out there!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"17v35-0-0\">But if you&#8217;re selling to English-speaking markets, focus on clear benefits, not features. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"17v35-0-0\">Not &#8220;We have 4.5-millimetre thick polypropylene plastic&#8221;. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"17v35-0-0\">But &#8220;This is almost unbreakable compared to other iPhone cases.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"92rnr-0-0\">You&#8217;ve answered the &#8220;So what?&#8221; question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 data-offset-key=\"ek0bg-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"ek0bg-0-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/12.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>CRO tactic 2: differentiation <\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"nuv2-0-0\">The other question that consumers have is &#8220;Why should I buy your product, not Joe blogs over here?&#8221;. And you <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"nuv2-1-0\">really<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"nuv2-2-0\"> need to answer that question. The answer is differentiation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"dnedh-0-0\">Your product may <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"dnedh-1-0\">be engineered<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"dnedh-2-0\"> to be different from the competitor&#8217;s products. I hope it is! But we all know re-designing products is a long and expensive process. It can take months. That&#8217;s especially true if you getting products from China or India. We&#8217;ve all been there! <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"1p9t1-0-0\">So let&#8217;s say your product itself isn&#8217;t very well engineered to be different. Well, you can still structure your listing to maximise differentiation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"auijs-0-0\">You need to articulate more <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"auijs-1-0\">clearly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"auijs-2-0\"> than your competitors how your product is different to their products<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"auijs-3-0\">. That&#8217;s about articulating in the fullest sentence, not <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"auijs-4-0\">just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"auijs-5-0\"> using words.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 data-offset-key=\"bsqv-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"bsqv-0-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/13.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>CRO Tactic 3: intelligent use of images<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"504np-0-0\">And that brings me to the last point. Yes, images have immense conversion power in e-commerce. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"504np-1-0\">But before you worry about the images, you need to clarify your benefits and your differentiation points<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"504np-2-0\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"fudc6-0-0\">Only then should you try and write those into sales copy. It needs to be coherent language that is punchy and direct and exciting. And which reflects your brand&#8217;s values and style. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"8os3r-0-0\">And only after you&#8217;ve done the copywriting in my experience, is it the time to go and hire photographers or graphic designers<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8os3r-1-0\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"9uts9-0-0\">The reason for this is simple: the brief. You&#8217;ve got to explain to your visual experts in clear words what you want. Yes, you can use images as examples, but that&#8217;s not enough. Skipping a clear brief will get sub-par results. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"3dbn5-0-0\">So a brief which I&#8217;ll be talking about soon with the professionals actually, but the brief is critical. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3dbn5-1-0\">It&#8217;s hard enough to communicate with a photographer or graphic designer exactly what you want from them<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3dbn5-2-0\">. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3dbn5-3-0\">If you&#8217;re not super clear in your mind exactly what you&#8217;re trying to communicate, it&#8217;s almost impossible<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3dbn5-4-0\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"t-1657146510645\" data-offset-key=\"2cj10-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"2cj10-0-0\">Clarity is everything. <\/span><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"37fv0-0-0\">What are the benefits of the selling points? What outcomes that people get from using this? Yes you have to link them to features. Benefits can&#8217;t be <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"37fv0-1-0\">just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"37fv0-2-0\"> abstract. But most sellers I work with go on about features far too much. So link benefits to features and you&#8217;re halfway there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"5cipn-0-0\">I was speaking to a very fine visual marketer, Daisy Sepulveda today. She runs a model agency and they do fantastic product photography for Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"3c230-0-0\">We are actually going to discuss how to write a good brief soon.

But an essential prelude to a brief is you being very clear on your message. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/4.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"t-1657146510646\" data-offset-key=\"26q17-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"26q17-0-0\">Books on Pricing Strategy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"ccr2h-0-0\">So these are all very practical pricing tactics. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ccr2h-1-0\"> I&#8217;m trying to keep my feet on the ground and report back from what&#8217;s happening on the ground rather than abstract stuff<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ccr2h-2-0\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"98e3o-0-0\">That said, if you <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"98e3o-1-0\">are interested<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"98e3o-2-0\"> in pricing strategy, then I&#8217;m going to recommend a couple of books. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"b78qf-0-0\"><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3ycO83S\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Priceless__The_Hidden_Psychology_of_Value.jpg?resize=194%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"194\" height=\"300\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>The first book is by <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3ycO83S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">William Poundstone: <em>Priceless, The Hidden Psychology Of Value<\/em><\/a><\/span><span data-offset-key=\"b78qf-1-0\"><em>(Amazon UK link) <\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"7vqem-0-0\">If you like business strategy books, <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7vqem-1-0\">I think<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"7vqem-2-0\"> you&#8217;ll find that fascinating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"djk2d-0-0\">The other book is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3nE7EBz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Pricing Power<\/em><\/a><span data-offset-key=\"djk2d-0-2\"> by Jason Miles of Omnirocket, <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"djk2d-1-0\">formerly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"djk2d-2-0\"> winning on Shopify. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"djk2d-2-0\">(<em>Amazon UK link) <\/em><\/span><span data-offset-key=\"djk2d-2-0\">And of course Jason is the co-host of The E-Commerce Leader podcast alongside me.

I see sellers doing this even though their cost prices are going up. It&#8217;s understandable. The sellers sense <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6l3se-2-0\">probably<\/span> <span data-offset-key=\"6l3se-4-0\">correctly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"6l3se-5-0\">, that the consumers are becoming more price sensitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"33sut-0-0\">Understandable &#8211; but in my view, wrong. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"2tj3v-0-0\">Are they more price-sensitive in your particular category? It <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2tj3v-1-0\">really<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"2tj3v-2-0\"> depends on your category.

So once again, I&#8217;m going to mention <a href=\"https:\/\/eva.guru\/solutions\/private-label-pricing\/?fpr=michael81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eva<\/a>, which is a repricing tool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"ijmf-0-0\">Two reasons why <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ijmf-1-0\">I think<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ijmf-2-0\"> Eva&#8217;s <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ijmf-3-0\">really<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"ijmf-4-0\"> different to the other repricing software out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 id=\"t-1657146510652\" data-offset-key=\"f3ps0-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"f3ps0-0-0\">Rules-based repricers vs Machine Learning<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"1nudo-0-0\">Firstly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1nudo-1-0\"> There&#8217;s plenty of repricing software for resellers. It tends to be rules-based. That means if it stops working the system, isn&#8217;t going to <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1nudo-2-0\">automatically<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1nudo-3-0\"> adjust. That in turn means you&#8217;ve got to do a lot of manual labour in monitoring it. Or you <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1nudo-4-0\">just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"1nudo-5-0\"> let it run &#8211; and lose money!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"8d9hs-0-0\">In contrast, <a href=\"https:\/\/eva.guru\/solutions\/private-label-pricing\/?fpr=michael81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eva<\/a> has an artificial intelligence engine. That means that their repricing learns from experience. That&#8217;s quite <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8d9hs-1-0\">profoundly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"8d9hs-2-0\"> different from rules-based.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 id=\"t-1657146510653\" data-offset-key=\"eu0ad-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"eu0ad-0-0\">Integrating Amazon Repricing and Inventory Management<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"bl580-0-0\">The second thing is kind of simple but complex at same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"bl580-1-0\">The simple thing is other repricing engines are <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bl580-2-0\">just<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bl580-3-0\"> obsessed with price and maximizing profit<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bl580-4-0\">. But of course, in reality, the biggest way to run out of profit is to run out of stock. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bl580-5-0\">Because when your inventory is gone in a product, your revenue <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bl580-6-0\">obviously<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bl580-7-0\"> falls to absolute zero<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bl580-8-0\">. And it stays at zero for as long as you&#8217;re out of stock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"bsvdf-0-0\">Plus, we all know that also Amazon can reduce your rankings for the right keywords, etcetera when you go out of stock<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bsvdf-1-0\">. Depending on the competitiveness of your category, that can <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bsvdf-2-0\">really<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bsvdf-3-0\"> hit <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bsvdf-3-1\">future<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"bsvdf-3-2\"> sales too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"3rnf4-0-0\">So going out of stock <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3rnf4-1-0\">clearly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"3rnf4-2-0\"> has very bad consequences.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 id=\"t-1657146510654\" data-offset-key=\"3rnf4-0-0\">The danger of separating repricing and inventory management<\/h4>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"4ndu2-0-0\">Why then would you want to price for profit <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"4ndu2-1-0\">abstractly<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"4ndu2-2-0\"> separate from whether you have stock? Well, you wouldn&#8217;t. Stock control needs to be integrated with your Amazon pricing strategy to really drive profits.<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"4ndu2-2-0\">But of course, most repricers work in a sort of vacuum in that way. <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"4ndu2-3-0\">Whereas <a href=\"https:\/\/eva.guru\/solutions\/private-label-pricing\/?fpr=michael81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eva<\/a> has a stock control and replenishment engine that integrates with the repricing engine<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"4ndu2-4-0\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span data-offset-key=\"9tua-0-0\">Now, <\/span><span data-offset-key=\"9tua-1-0\">I think<\/span><span data-offset-key=\"9tua-2-0\"> that&#8217;s super smart.
