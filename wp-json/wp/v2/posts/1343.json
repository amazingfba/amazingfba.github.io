In October of 2016, incentivised reviews were banned in the US, then shortly after, Germany, the UK, and the whole of Europe. How do you do an Amazon product launch now?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mywifequitherjob.com\/selling-on-amazon-greg-mercer\/\">Greg has first-hand experience<\/a> with this as he has launched six or seven products since October; three or four in the last few weeks. An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BqX19Vexn9U\">Amazon product launch<\/a> is very different after this updated Terms of Service was released.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a 10,000 ft. look at this. In order to rank organically on Amazon, you need to have sales. There are a few ways to get sales. You can make your products really cheap, you can try to drive outside traffic, you can use deal sites like <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/jumpsend\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JumpSend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Without sales, you can launch your product but it will end up in the deep dark hole of Amazon and no one will find it. As Amazon sellers, we need to be thinking about how we can get sales on a product that is not organically ranking and \u00a0doesn\u2019t have any reviews so there\u2019s no social proof.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greg utilizes his <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/jumpsend\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JumpSend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tool. It\u2019s a deal site where about 30,000 people are visiting and looking for good deals. It\u2019s no longer a place to get reviews, it\u2019s a place to get sales. It still works, and it is completely within the Terms of Service of Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Greg puts his products on <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/jumpsend\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JumpSend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Then he offers it at a price people want it, which can vary. He offers about five coupons a day, maybe ten if it\u2019s competitive. From this, he is getting sales. He will do this for about a week. After that time, the product will be ranking very well. From those sales, a few will end up resulting in a review. He will also turn on pay-per-click advertising (PPC). It\u2019s costly, but it does get you sales. That\u2019s what you need to get started; you have to have these sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where most people go wrong, is that they get scared of spending the money. Usually, Greg has to turn PPC so high that he is losing money on that sale. If he is offering 70% off, then he is likely losing money. People seem to get shy about losing money. However, that\u2019s a part of doing business but you will recoup this money in the long-term. A big problem for people is that they\u2019re afraid to bid the PPC that high, or they\u2019re afraid to give that big of a discount because they\u2019re afraid of losing money. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s the gist of it. To do an Amazon product launch, you have to force sales somehow. The easiest way is deal sites and PPC. Then you\u2019ll start ranking organically, and start getting reviews. Another thing is that you definitely want to have an email follow up sequence turned on. You can use any tool for that, but keep in mind that <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/jumpsend\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JumpSend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is also a follow-up email service as well as a deal site. It\u2019s nice that it is a full launch package. No matter what you use, before you do your first giveaway, you need to have some sort of email follow-up that asks for a review.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first email will thank them for the purchase. The second may let them know that they can contact you if you have any issues. The third could ask for a review. With an email sequence you\u2019ll see that you can get 10-15 reviews out of 100 compared to the 3 out of 100 you may get without one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to the coupons, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/leticiamiranda\/amazon-marketplace-sellers-black-hat-scams-search-rankings\">Amazon forbids any action that tries to manipulate the sales ranking<\/a>, and in a way, giving out coupons does that. It\u2019s not so much following the letter of the law but how Amazon sees that. If you give coupons to only <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/jumpsend\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JumpSend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> users but not to the general public, is that potentially violating the Terms of Service?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a clause in the ToS that was release in the first quarter of 2016 that said something to the effect that purposely manipulating sales rank is against the rules. It comes down to, what does this mean? It is a bit of a grey area. Greg\u2019s personal opinion is that Amazon put that in because, at the time, sellers were doing these massive giveaways, especially in the supplement category. They were giving away about 100 units everyday for a couple days. That is probably what that clause was looking to prevent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.junglescout.com\/blog\/amazon-product-promotions\/\">is giving away a couple coupons a day considered manipulating sales rank<\/a>? All Greg really cares about is making sales and ranking organically in the search results. Since those Terms of Service were released, there hasn\u2019t been anyone, that we\u2019re aware of, that has gotten in trouble for manipulating sales rank. Some have gotten in trouble for some review type infractions. They have been big sellers doing about $500,000 a month. One seller, their VA got in touch with a top reviewer, didn\u2019t ask for a review but it might have been implicated that they expected one, and their account was suspended for two months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some sellers have mentioned that some of their reviews were removed if the discount was too high. The sales were legitimate and organic in every way, but if the discount was over 50% off the regular price, then they were removed. You mention that you might give 70%-80% off, does that create any issues, as far as Terms of Service?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon\u2019s ToS are really vague, so Greg bases his knowledge off data and what people are actually experiencing. Whatever you do, do NOT imply that they are getting the discount in exchange for a review! That is a clear violation of Amazon\u2019s ToS. If a person uses a coupon to buy a product, you\u2019re just giving out coupons to make sales. Since October, Gerg has noticed that some of the reviews have been marked \u201cunverified\u201d, so he assumes that those are the ones bought with a coupon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no way to know since you can\u2019t track a review to an order. It seems that, for now, they are sticking. They might not stick a year from now. For the short-term, they are nice to have since, when you do an Amazon product launch, you won\u2019t have many reviews. So even though they are unverified, it\u2019s better to have them than little to no reviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They\u2019ve done a lot of testing, and there is no one number, say 30% off, that will get a product verified. Some products, you can give a 50% off coupon and it will show verified. You can give 20% on another, and that will result in it being unverified. Even if you post it publically in the listing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s reassuring\u00a0that you\u2019re not hearing about people getting their accounts suspended for giving away coupons and that, if you have a follow-up sequence, you can still get reviews. Since you have so many <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/jumpsend\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JumpSend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> users, you have a good amount of data. Also, that Amazon doesn\u2019t seem as trigger happy with this as they seem to be with reviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greg gives away about 5-10 units a day. That isn\u2019t really manipulating sales rank. If it was 100 units a day or 500 units a day, it is probably more likely that Amazon will come knocking on your door. You just have to be mindful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the reviews, it\u2019s worth repeating, you CANNOT give a coupon with the purpose of getting a review, or expect a review, or require a review. There is no more incentivised review.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You were talking about adjusting to new realities in 2017. At the end of last year, we tried to launch some products without an Amazon product launch service. With all the talk around incentivized reviews being banned and the risk of account suspension, I think we were a bit too risk averse. So It\u2019s good to know that <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/jumpsend\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JumpSend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is still an option.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greg and some others that were running review sites had the chance to speak with Amazon lawyers. At first it was a bit scary but in the end it was a great experience. The lawyers were willing to work with them because they were looking to make the whole industry more legitimate and do away with the whole incentivized reviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were a few things that aren\u2019t in the ToS, but they did put it in writing. Big picture, you can\u2019t incentivise anyone you\u2019re giving a coupon to, in any way, to leave a review. An example of this, is that there were a lot of Facebook groups that had implied reviews with each other. They were saying that you don\u2019t have to leave a review, but if you do you get more coupons. That\u2019s not okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They\u2019re not cool with you checking their review profile to see if they left a review. You may not require a review, but maybe you could check \u00a0to see if they left one or not, and kick them out of the Facebook group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offering them more deals or giving them more coupons if they left a review is something Amazon is not okay with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, anything you do to check up on reviews, or anything link to reviews at all. That was when ReviewKick was relaunched as JumpSend. It\u2019s totally legit and by the books. They have the lawyers blessing. You give out coupons to these people, but you have no idea who they are, you can\u2019t follow up to see if they left a review. They don\u2019t get more coupons for reviews. You\u2019re just giving away coupons in the hopes of getting more sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another thing that was surprising, Amazon\u2019s not dumb. They are very in the loop. All these Facebook groups with the implied reviews, there is probably an Amazon lawyer in the group. Amazon is\u00a0very attuned with what sellers are doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s surprising that people think they can fly under the radar. Amazon is one of the biggest companies in the world, and third-party sellers account for \u2153 of their sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_49\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=49\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Greg Mercer on Amazon Product Launch &#8211;
