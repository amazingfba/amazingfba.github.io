Or it will get put to back of the queue etc. etc. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">If you get moved back to the back of the line so you\u2019re out of stock for several weeks, you could be losing $100 a day in lost profit!\u00a0This doesn&#8217;t compare to 10 cents a unit!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t get hung up on low price if it\u2019s profitable. If there\u2019s something left in it for the factory, they\u2019ll be more inclined to be helpful. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">(This ties in with Peter Zapf\u2019s advice &#8211; Global Sources). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Actually factories do have rising costs. Going out there has given Greg a perspective. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Your suppliers are a crucial part of your business so treat them well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Apart from Chinese new year are there any other times of the year that slow down the manufacturing rate such as the Canton Fair?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Gearing up to 4th quarter in Sept, Oct means longer queues. Seasonal items like patio products would be even worse because that involves Chinese New Year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Just say to your supplier, I\u2019m planning the year out (and they will like this!) so can you let me know when you will need longer to manufacture? This actually sends great signals: a. you&#8217;re organised b. you are planning to order regularly.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Is there any way of ensuring that once you have differentiated a product from a supplier (by colour or design) that the supplier won\u2019t then send your differentiated product out to other customers as samples and then they will just order the same differentiated product (just with their logo on it)?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Short answer: not really! You can try to work with your supplier on this &#8211; you can try to get them to sign something which could possibly work. But if you tore them apart about saving 6 cents on something, they probably won\u2019t do it!\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Talk to them about it. You have the most negotiating power BEFORE you place your first order. Or first large order. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">However, even if your factory does that, there are probably 7 other factories making the same product. Don\u2019t get too hung up on that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">So how do you\u00a0build\u00a0a defensive wall around your products?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It&#8217;s almost impossible to do fully with a private Label product.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">But if you go into a newish market or you are the first into a market with a modification, you can use the time that buys you (say 3-6 months) to build reviews and sales rank to get a solid head start on the competition. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0An example from Greg: first person to sell a product with metal instead of plastic buckles. For 6 months he was the only one; now there are 15 others doing it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>even though there is tons of competition, he has top rank, 400 reviews, the best pictures etc. So he hasn\u2019t really seen sales decrease. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>When I looked on Aliexpress at getting just a few items of the product I was interested in, they seemed quite expensive (like the same amount as similar products were selling for on amazon) and I would be making quite a big loss once I included import duties and FBA fees. <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do people just take this loss to test if a product sells or is there any negotiating on price on aliexpress rather than alibaba?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Greg has never used AliExpress &#8211; but it is bound to more expensive because there are no economies of scale! Just treat it is as a market and supplier test. Or to be more cost effective, \u00a0you could just place an order for say 100 units with an Alibaba supplier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Would Greg recommend going the route of getting an agent to source products from different suppliers, rather than contacting different suppliers individually through something like Alibaba?\u00a0 If so what is the best way of finding a trustworthy Agent?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Greg for the first year or so just went direct to suppliers. He found an agent as someone\u00a0he already worked with at a factory. Everyone Greg knows who uses an agent met them through an established relationship. [Same is true for Michael]. In China it\u2019s all about relationships anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">T<\/span><span class=\"s1\">here are small advantages to having an agent, such as factories not on Alibaba,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>but you do have to pay them a cut! <\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0It&#8217;s really\u00a0 more about outsourcing than money saving. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do people find out more about you and <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/junglescout\">Jungle Scout<\/a>?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Greg writes a solid<a href=\"http:\/\/www.junglescout.com\/blog\"> blog post <\/a>each week. There\u2019s a cool product case study (\u201cJungle Stix\u201d). Just comment on the blog or Tweet: @mercer_greg<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What are your views and thoughts on trends you see happening on Amazon?\u00a0<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>What are the most successful sellers doing right now? <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">One thing successful sellers have in common: if you can make a small improvement on a product, it works really well. Find a product with mostly 3 star reviews. Read the 1 and 2 star reviews; if it&#8217;s something simple you can fix, make the improvement they ask for. You can both take away sales and charge a premium for it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For example the product with metal buckle vs plastic buckles &#8211; Greg sold his for $29 and the competition was selling for $14.95 , and the cost difference to Greg was about 50 cents!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Also larger\/oversized items, although there are still opportunities with smaller, unmodified products.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What\u2019s new and what do you see coming in terms of changes that we should be thinking about adapting to?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If looking at 2016, &amp; probably 2017, there will still be lots of good opportunities in the .com store especially with modifications and larger\/oversized items. Realistically it probably will start<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>to get really competitive by say 2018. By then a lot of other marketplaces like UK, Germany, Japan and India will be maturing with more demand, which Greg will be entering in due course.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Parting Advice:<br \/>\n<\/b>If you\u2019ve been listening to the podcast and researching for a while, it\u2019s time to get started. A lot of people seem to be worrying about things they don\u2019t need to worry about. You\u2019ll hit little roadblocks but it\u2019s important to keep pushing forward, get your 1st product up for sale. It\u2019s probably not as complex as you think!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS PODCAST<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A podcast is a free downloadable audio show that enables you to learn while you\u2019re on the go.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>To subscribe to my podcast for free, you\u2019ll need an app to listen to the show from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For iPhone\/iPad\/iPod listeners \u2013 Grab your phone or device and go to the iTunes store and search \u201cAmazing FBA\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will help you to download the free Podcasts App (produced by Apple) and then subscribe to the show from within that app.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Every time I produce a new episode, you\u2019ll get it downloaded right on yt sentence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For podcast enthusiasts \u2013 If you already listen to podcasts and have a podcatcher that you prefer, the feed you\u2019ll need to add is: http:\/\/ amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who don\u2019t have a mobile device \u2013 You can always listen to the show by clicking the audio file at the top of this page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have any queries, just go to www.amazingfba.com\/ask<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_49\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=49\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Supplier Negotiation The Future Of Amazon With Greg Mercer &#8211;
