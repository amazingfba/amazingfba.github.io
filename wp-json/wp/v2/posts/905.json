Is that correct and could you expand on that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. It hard to seem credible if you have five reviews and everyone else has 100, so you have to work for those reviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How much is enough? And what do you do now\u00a0that incentivised reviews have been removed?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many depends on the product. It depends on what page one looks like for you products\u2019 search terms. There is still opportunity out there. There are a lot of products with low reviews that are still dominating. Adam would use <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ilovetoreview.com<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which he also owns, to get 25 reviews for products in the UK and 50 in the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Find out more of Adam&#8217;s latest thinking <a href=\"https:\/\/online.reliable.education\/free-amazon-training-course1?affiliate_id=516769&amp;aff_sub=Show%20notes%20(blog)&amp;aff_sub2=Facebook%20Group&amp;nopopup=false&amp;noautoplay=false\">HERE<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s only in the US that incentivised reviews are gone and it\u2019s only compulsory reviews. There are other services that never guarantee the review but would push out your products at a discounted rate or for free. It\u2019s not clear how it works, but it seem that after you get around 25 or 30 sales in a day then you products get a jump start and the sales keep rolling in. So even if you\u2019re not getting a guaranteed review, there is still value in pushing your products out at a discounted rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam can only speak to his community at ilovetoreview.com, but the reviewers have been doing this for three years where they use the coupon, get the product, and write the review. So, they will probably continue to do so even though it can no longer be required. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies will continue to do this\u00a0even if the review rate drops in half. Adam\u2019s company has a review rate of 87% meaning 87% of products that were pushed out came back as a review. With these new rules, that will likely drop. And if it drops in half that means you will just have to send out twice as many products. This is a one-time investment for something that can generate income for life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another tip from Adam is to follow up with you customers via email. Especially in the UK, they are very responsive to this. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/zonguru.com\/affiliate\/idevaffiliate.php?id=amazingfba\">Zonguru<\/a>\u00a0(which Adam also own)<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0has this automation built in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time you make a sale it can send an email when it ships, six days later following up with any issues,and 14 days later asking for a review. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not\u00a0only will this help in getting reviews, but it allows you to get ahead of any issues with the product, say if the box was damaged or the product\u00a0wasn\u2019t right, allowing you to take care of the issue without before going through Amazon\u2019s return system. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam tries to casual in his style in his emails. Just a quick &#8220;Hey, how are you doing? Just wanted to make sure everything is good with the product.&#8221; He doesn\u2019t try to sound like a big company with huge copy in the email, just a quick message like you would send to an acquaintance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bogeyman in all this, as Adam puts it, is that Amazon can change this against this type of thing. They have already sued a bunch a review companies last year. All they have to do is make a change in the algorithm that scrutinizes those reviews that have reviewed an above average amount of products, and out of those, how many used a coupon and just wipe out those reviews. They can just remove reviews of people who are just reviewers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one knows how things will work out, but sellers will just have to adjust. They will still have to do product launches, just like every company in the world when they launch a new product. You just have to follow up and encourage your customers to leave a review. You only need 25 &#8211; 50 &#8211; \u00a0if you need more than that you\u2019ve gone into the wrong niche.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>As you say- \u00a0Amazon has the ability to wipe out these reviews if it chooses. It just drives the point, that at the end of the day it comes down to organic reviews and organic sales.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Just make great products that people like. It\u2019s that simple. And don\u2019t be impatient. Adam likes the way this is because it knocks out all the people that think they can get rich quick on terrible products. It\u2019s about putting in the work. Putting in the effort. That gives him the freedom to sit around all day, and look at his seller account and see that he made $3,000 in \u00a0a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned earlier that you teach this stuff. How do you do that? Is it live webinars, live courses, group training?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has a company called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/reliableincome.clickfunnels.com\/affiliate\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reliable Education<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The aim is to give people a realistic expectation going in and tell them the truth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the website, you can enroll in a free training program that is four videos where he shows you his home and drives you around where he lives in Australia. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He educates you on what the Amazon opportunity is, how to find products and his criteria for that. He teaches you about \u201cVelicity Retailing\u201d which is how to compound your capital over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All this leads to a\u00a0paid programme which is an online course where you get access to about 90 videos that show you Chinese factories and how a 3D printer is made and a lot of very cool stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It includes a private Facebook community and will link you with a mastermind group that they cap at seven people. Everyone signs a NDA so they can freely talk about what their companies are doing and talk on Google Hangouts or in person, and they\u2019re all trained with the same philosophy of not being opportunistic, not get rich quick. They are solid people that want to build solid businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also have 12 coaching webinars with each member of the course. They have an onboarding program for every new member. There are two guys whose job it is to call every new member and talk to them and get a feel for them. They also have a program where they loan money to a 3rd-world entrepreneur, interest-free, and gets paid back over time. People seem to find a lot of value since their refund rate is less than 5%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How do listeners get hold of you or find out more about you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/online.reliable.education\/free-amazon-training-course1?affiliate_id=516769&amp;aff_sub=Website&amp;aff_sub2=&amp;nopopup=false&amp;noautoplay=false\">reliable.education.\u00a0<\/a>Adam doesn&#8217;t really use Twitter etc. so you can&#8217;t catch him there &#8211; sounds like he&#8217;s more likely to be on his boat!<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_19\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=19\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Adam Hudson on Amazon Basics Part 4<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vim8bOtaJk0&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F102_Adam_Hudson_on_Amazon_Basics_Pt._4.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F100-adam-hudson-on-amazon-basics-pt-4%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/102_Adam_Hudson_on_Amazon_Basics_Pt._4.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=905-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/102_Adam_Hudson_on_Amazon_Basics_Pt._4.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"102_Adam_Hudson_on_Amazon_Basics_Pt._4.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 22:04 &#8212; 18.0MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 22:04 &#8212; 18.0MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSS To find out more of Adam&#8217;s own strategies and tactics, CLICK HERE Reviews are a major part of any strategy and you mentioned earlier that you want enough reviews to seem viable.
