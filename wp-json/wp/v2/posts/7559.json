You can\u2019t just hope to bite off a bigger slice of the market without putting first the work into it. And by work, we mean equipping your business to handle your ambitions. Growth is, after all, a bet you take on your company. While on paper it looks like an investment to reach the next level, the reality is a little different. Every investment is built on hope, namely the hope that your business can sustain growth and increase its revenues. While some might call it expectation or forecast, there is no denying that even data-driven decisions sometimes need to rely on a little luck too. You can, after all, only predict what you know. Most businesses don\u2019t receive sufficient insightful data to define a clear growth trajectory. As a result, planning growth is a delicate balancing act between making the necessary expansion investments and keeping your fingers crossed. However, somewhere in between, there is plenty of room for costly mistakes that can put your growth process at risk. Messing up your recruiting strategy is, by far, one of the most destructive things you can do to your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/cup-2592041_1920.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"7560\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/5-ways-your-recruitment-strategy-goes-wrong\/cup-2592041_1920\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/cup-2592041_1920.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"cup-2592041_1920\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/cup-2592041_1920.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/cup-2592041_1920.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7560 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/cup-2592041_1920.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/cup-2592041_1920.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/cup-2592041_1920.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/cup-2592041_1920.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/cup-2592041_1920.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4><b>You don\u2019t understand what you need<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing your team is an overwhelming challenge that implies filling positions that didn\u2019t exist previously. As an employer, you need to be very clear about the type of skills and talent you need. However, gaining clarity about roles that you haven\u2019t needed until now can be tricky. Therefore, it\u2019s not uncommon for employers to create <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.firstbird.com\/en\/magazine\/7-mistakes-when-writing-a-job-description-2\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unrealistic expectations in their job descriptions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While the desire is to make the role sound important; there\u2019s a thin line between underlying real functions and \u201caccidentally\u201d exaggerating requirements in an effort to make your company appear more professional. Similarly, failing to include essential and unique details about the company processes and niche market can confuse potential candidates and attract the wrong crowd.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>You don\u2019t know how to check candidates<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you\u2019ve read the resumes? That\u2019s only the beginning. You can\u2019t afford to pursue the hiring process without the support of professionals. Indeed, you need to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/checkr.com\/solutions\/industries\/staffing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hire a background check company<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ensure your potential employees are suitable and trustworthy. The typical background check includes criminal records check, credit history, specific industry accreditations, right to work, and even identity verification. Depending on the type of industry and the level of confidential data your employees are entrusted with, the checks will be more or less detailed. For instance, credit checks may not be relevant to jobs outside of the financial sector.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>You don\u2019t plan their stay<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hiring the right candidate is detrimental to your growth. But keeping your employees once you\u2019ve hired them is a lot more critical. Unfortunately, employee retention can be challenging, especially for companies that are growing rapidly. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/employee-retention-strategies\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best employee retention strategies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> require time and effort, which may not be manageable when you\u2019re trying to run an expanding business. Ideally, you want your employees to feel appreciated from Day One, which means that you have to make your priority to plan their arrival and integrate them into your team smoothly. Employers can\u2019t afford to neglect job satisfaction; running regular surveys in-house can highlight potential issues that affect your staff happiness and motivation. Making your business a great workplace is a promise you make every employee.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>You don\u2019t make time for your employees<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody grows. Your employees are keen to embrace their personal development journey and learn new skills with you. Additionally, they also hope to discuss areas of improvement, both within the company and with their work. Supporting personal growth is detrimental to your expansion. While it might seem like a waste of time, your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/wavelength.asana.com\/workstyle-what-is-a-1-1\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one-to-one meetings play a crucial role<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in maintaining your success. It\u2019s about making time for each employee and helping them to become the best they can be. Falling behind on your one-to-one meetings affect your relationship with your team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>You\u2019ve changed the role<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might have hired someone for a specific position, but as the company grows, you realize to need a new palette of skills. Ultimately, your employees understand they need to adapt to new demands. However, they are not ready for an unplanned role change. It is not unfair for your staff to move them into new functions \u2013 more importantly, functions they didn\u2019t apply for \u2013 without addressing the issue with them first. Similarly, you can\u2019t pile up new duties to their list of existing responsibilities without considering what the new role means, both in terms of training and pay rise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the best talents for your company is the easiest part of the recruiting process. Keeping your employees, ensuring they can grow with your business and deliver the best performance day after day is the biggest challenge you\u2019ll ever face. Learning to put people\u2019s interests first can help you to maintain your growth strategy and aim for success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Growth is an organic process that needs to happen across the whole business.
