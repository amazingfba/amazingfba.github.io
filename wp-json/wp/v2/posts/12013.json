Instead of people unilaterally suing companies, they\u2019re hiring law firms to represent them as a group, allowing them to get greater financial leverage and more access to justice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Class action has been around for a long time. But it is only recently that systems have come into place that make it more accessible. And this new reality is terrifying sellers. Changes in the structure of civil cases means that they could find themselves on the receiving end of a lawsuit at any time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What Are Class Action Lawsuits?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Class action lawsuits come about when two or more individuals make a claim against the same wrongdoer. In most cases, people file class action lawsuits against companies, though they can file against other societal entities too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When companies face class action lawsuits, they are at risk of substantial losses. In many cases, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/1990\/01\/five-ways-to-keep-disputes-out-of-court\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">organizations settle outside of court<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, often paying large sums of money to those they allegedly did harm. Typically, the settlement route is preferable to going before a judge where the compensation is even larger.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why Do Class Action Lawsuits Arise?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Class action lawsuits typically arise for two reasons:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defective products<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">False promises<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thefllawfirm.com\/defective-drugs-and-devices.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">defective drugs and devices attorneys<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regularly represent people seeking class action if medications harm them. Physicians and hospitals will sometimes allow groups of patients to use devices and technologies that haven\u2019t passed the proper safety procedures, opening the door to negligence claims against them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.lse.ac.uk\/management\/2018\/04\/03\/breaking-promises-is-bad-for-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">False promises are another major issue<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here a company makes a tangible promise to its customers that it cannot deliver on. For example, Hoover offered customers free vacation benefits when they bought its products, but eventually it found the scheme too expensive and had to shut it down.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How Do You Protect Your Business Against Class Action?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are shocked to find themselves on the receiving end of a class action lawsuit. They assume that it is something that only affects larger companies, not them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that\u2019s not the case. Small businesses are often the target of class action, including <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/amazon-seller-analytics-with-hiba-weber-of-seller-mobile\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sellers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, often because they\u2019ve made basic errors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To protect yourself, you\u2019ll need to do the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Buy insurance.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Many insurance companies offer liability insurance that covers class action lawsuits. Before you take out a policy, you\u2019ll need to check the terms with a fine tooth comb. Make sure that the insurer actually protects against class action, not just individual claims against your firm. Research the average payout for class action cases in your industry and ensure that you have the appropriate level of cover.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Audit your supply chain.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Never sell customers junk. Always ensure that it meets all legal safety standards before distribution. Check with suppliers to ensure that you can trace every component from the source. Keep tabs on your shipments and put security features in place that let you identify counterfeits.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Deliver on your promises<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Lastly, never promise customers anything that you can\u2019t deliver. Always make good on your promises and stay true to your word.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Class action lawsuits are becoming more popular.
