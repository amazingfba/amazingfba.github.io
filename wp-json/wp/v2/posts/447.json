A hunk of rubber, wood, plastic. So: very few moving parts, no electronics, hard to break, etc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Keep it simple! That\u2019s how Will is able to travel the world with a laptop!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Don\u2019t follow weird passions like Robotic toys! Many people overcomplicate Amazon. Don\u2019t try to make it as hard as possible; make it as easy as possible!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do we make it as simple as possible?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Think of everything that can go wrong. If you can\u2019t think of anything, that\u2019s a good product choice!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Will likes to sell (mostly) to Needs not Wants, e.g., Polka Dot underwear vs. a bolt. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s not just about price. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">If you sell a 10 inch bolt for $8 instead of $12, most people will buy it because all bolts look the same. They\u2019re not saying \u201cSome day I\u2019m going to buy this 10 inch bolt\u201d! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Also if you need to liquidate such a product, there\u2019s a clear market for it, to reduce your risk. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How can you build profit into that for yourself?<\/b><br \/>\nEmail the supplier and ask how much would it be for 1000 units of this product? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">If they say, $1 a unit landed cost, do some quick math[s]:\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">If selling for $8, paying $3.60 or $4.50 in<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>fees, so still making $3 each. So for every one dollar invested, he\u2019s getting $3 back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you have a minimum or max selling price?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">No it\u2019s more like a timespan to profit ratio. Also it\u2019s about time you\u2019re spending for what return. If you\u2019re spending all day on something with a 15% return, that\u2019s not<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>as good as something with a 33% return where you simply reorder every 3 months.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<b>So it comes back to cashflow?<\/b><br \/>\nIf I gave you \u00a310 million now, could you make $2 m back in a year? Yes!\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">If I gave you $500K, could you? No. [But if you returned 20% every 2 months on it, you\u2019d end up with $1.492 million &#8211; Michael]<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"> So it\u2019s all about getting cash back as fast as possible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Compounding interest is the 8th wonder of the world, so you need to take advantage of it! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you deal with increasing competition in Amazon Private Label?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">As competition grows in a niche, Will sends his products directly to Amazon, and Amazon gets nearly 100% of the Buy Box. The margins are lower but Will gets the sale nearly all the time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Vendor Express (where you can apply) and Vendor Central (invitation only) are the places that Amazon will do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have some kind of sales history, Just go to Vendor Express, tell Amazon \u201cI want to sell these items directly to you\u201d, you offer a price, they tell you if they accept that or not-they often will. If they accept, t<\/span><span class=\"s1\">hey will start placing Purchase Orders and you sell directly to them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019ll have to keep some inventory to hand, [and you\u2019ll have to accept getting paid 59 days in arrears!-Michael]. But if\u00a0it\u2019s a Private Label product, Amazon will outrank all others for the product for that keyword. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Is that open to everyone?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Vendor Express is &#8211; just google it and sign up!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Is that what you do when PL is not viable for profit any more?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s not normally a price war &#8211; it\u2019s usually if someone else optimises their listing etc. (Private Label sellers) and does giveaways. Will has too many SKU\u2019s to watch any individual listing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you manage 2000 listings?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s manageable because Will has only about 20 suppliers. He uses software like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stitchlabs.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Stitch Labs<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecomengine.com\/restockpro\"><span class=\"s2\">Restock pro<\/span><\/a>, which will alert him when (according to his presets like lead time) a product line needs restocking. When he has built up a big enough order of products from one supplier, he\u2019ll go to the supplier. Will has good knowledge in his mind of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>which suppliers have short or long lead times<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are you literally keeping it all in your head Like a chess game?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Often it\u2019s triggered by writing a cheque. Or you can just go down a checklist by supplier. It doesn\u2019t take long. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re ordering 100 SKUs from one supplier, you can just order say 50 units of each and still fill a container.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>So Will gets economies of scale but doesn\u2019t risk much in any individual SKU. Also you\u2019re turning that cash around quickly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>\u201cCashflow is everything\u201d. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Where do you see the relationship between Amazon and Private Label sellers going over the next year or two?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Competition is growing but a lot of the time the competition are doing the same dumb things! So over the next 2 years, there will still be profit to be made. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"> Within 5-10 years, for anything that is a semi-commodity, China is just going to sell directly to Amazon. Amazon is opening training centres in China. So you\u2019ll need to stay in low-competition niches and fly below the radar. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What sort of commodity products would that be?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Everything in the top 100 BSR that is not a real US brand name. Shopping on needs will be taken over by Amazon: eg silicon spatula &#8211; if Amazon can source it and sell it profitably for $2.99 and PL sellers have to sell at $9.99 to break even, Amazon will win the sale every time and therefore build massive numbers of listings. Amazon Basics is only going to get bigger and bigger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you see yourself dealing with this increasing competition?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Will partly depends on the US brands to keep growing their businesses with their own marketing, product research and sourcing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have 4 SKUs total and one gets de-ranked because a bunch of Chinese sellers come in, you\u2019ve lost 25% of revenue.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Will has his risk much more diversified. Also he can see trends coming from a long way off via his many SKUs. He will be able to pivot at this point if needed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Will follows the investment principles: Diversify and get cashflow. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How can<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>people who are starting out take advantage of this?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s not one size fits all! That\u2019s why so many courses out there don\u2019t make sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8211;<strong>If you have $500 [\u00a3342] to invest<\/strong>, flip stuff from AliExpress, drop ship or get a second job and save more cash. Will suggests find a successful Amazon seller and work for them for $15 an hour and learn how it works. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"> &#8211;<strong>$5000 [\u00a33422] to invest<\/strong> is on the border. Will says it\u2019s hard to order just $2500 of stuff from China (you\u2019ll need to keep $2500 in cash). Maybe you can find a small retailer or do some Retail Arbitrage or find a wholesaler who will allow you to drop ship their larger products &#8211; eg, a fireplace manufacturer (big, bulky stuff). It\u2019s not quite enough to start a business!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">If you can go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aliexpress.com\">AliExpress<\/a>, lead times are so much quicker [than on Alibaba] -you can have a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>product in your hands within 10 days. If you find something profitable on Alibaba, see if you can air freight it and still make a profit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">If you can invest say $3000 [\u00a32,053] to make $700 back after a month or so, that is a very good start [23%return-Michael]. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">As you order more, the profit margins will only get bigger over time. The rich get richer on Amazon. The more you sell, the better you rank; the more you sell, the more you can buy, so the price you buy at gets lower and your profit margin gets bigger. As you grow, it gets easier. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8211;<strong>$10,000 [\u00a36843] to invest<\/strong> is enough to order from China [by sea]- a $5000 order will get you somewhere &#8211; you could Private Label or find a Mom and Pop shop that does say $10m a year in revenue or less (spend half of inventory and keep the cash back).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8211;<strong>if you have $50K [\u00a33,4216] to invest<\/strong>, you can just call up wholesalers off the bat and say you have \u00a310K to invest. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you get bigger and bigger, it becomes ever more important to save money.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>For example, if Will can increase profit by 1% by saving money, when turning over $10m a year, that\u2019s $100,000 extra profit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">At a 20% margin, that would be extra sales of $500K a year to make that profit number up. So it\u2019s a lot easier to make more profit by saving money than extra sales. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Try to just sell as much as possible as the beginning, but at some point you will need to lower your costs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How can people find out more about you, Will?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Email: <a href=\"mailto:williamtjernlund@gmail.com\"><span class=\"s2\">williamtjernlund@gmail.com<\/span><\/a> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Twitter: @wtjern <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amzhelp.com\"><span class=\"s2\">www.amzhelp.com<\/span><\/a> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Facebook: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tjernlund\"><span class=\"s2\">www.facebook.com\/tjernlund<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is your parting advice for someone wanting to get started?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t go after your passion, go where the cash is.
