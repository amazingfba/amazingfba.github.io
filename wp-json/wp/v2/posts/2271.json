We are going to be discussing trademarks for Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people have fear around legal issues because they are important topics. Most of us either sit in worry or duck our heads into the sand because we don\u2019t know what to do. To help with this in one area where many Amazon sellers have fear, Anthony is here today to talk about patents and trademarks for Amazon. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Intellectual Property: Trademarks, Copyright, and Patents<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony finds people generally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/help\/faq\/faq-general.html\">understand copyright<\/a> and to a certain extent, trademarks. However, the most common mistake he sees is people confusing trademarks with patents. People think that if they register their own trademark and private label their product that they are protected from patent law, but that\u2019s not true. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/t\/trademark.asp\">Trademarks<\/a> are used to identify the source or quality of the goods and are often about the branding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.avasam.com\/what-is-a-patent\/\">patent<\/a> is a government-granted right. It\u2019s the right to exclude other people from advertising, offering for sale or importing your invention without your approval. There are utility patents and design patents. The utility patent covers what you would think of as an invention or the useful part of an invention. A design patent covers the appearance or ornamental, non-functional aspect of an invention. To get the most protection people will usually try to register both at the same time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For copyright, you can\u2019t copyright the idea. But if you put it into a tangible medium\u2014whether you write it or record it\u2014you can. Once it\u2019s in that tangible medium you can protect it by registering a copyright. With a patent, you can protect the actual use of it, and it can be the idea. If properly drafted it protects your idea for that invention or product. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>An Example of Utility vs. Design Patent<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say you are looking at a phone case that has a light on it to light up your pictures and make your selfies better. The use of the light on the phone case would be protected by a utility patent. Then the design patent could be used to protect the appearance of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One product can get protection from utility patent and design patent. Getting a design patent is much simpler in that it usually just has one claim. Usually is just illustrations of the product. It is much faster and easier to get protection for your products through a design patent. The utility patent is much more complex, much harder to define. It\u2019s harder to find it there\u2019s already a patent that exists and then if there isn\u2019t. It\u2019s harder to construct your own application for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Clearance Searches<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony recommends looking into this for new private label products before spending money on manufacturing. The first step is to do a clearance search. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start with your own research via the United States Patent and Trademark Office at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uspto.gov\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uspto.gov<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where you can search for patents and trademarks. That is the starting point in terms of doing your own research for your trademarks for Amazon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your own research will help you to identify whether or not you should have a cursory or preliminary search done. If you do, and that preliminary search is successful then you can make a business decision as to whether or not to make sure before you go any further. That\u2019s when you do a more extensive search. At that point, Anthony says you have to hire someone to make sure because you need to find out early whether or not it\u2019s worth it to go further with your private label product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony advises even if you can\u2019t afford a comprehensive search, have at least a preliminary search done. He recommends spending a little bit, under $1000. It\u2019s worth that investment and everyone should do that at least. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to weigh up for yourself the risk vs reward. People want to put in $3000 and get out $10,000, but the reality is you could put in $3000 and end up with $0 if you go really wrong. Be aware of the possible downsides as well as the upsides.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Common Mistakes with Trademarks for Amazon<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One common mistake is private label sellers not taking all the steps to protect their own rights before they begin. Such as not registering their trademark. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.junglescout.com\/blog\/trademarks-for-amazon-sellers\/\">Trademark rights<\/a> are based on first use not first to file but you never want to have to try to fight for your trademark later and prove that although they filed it first you were using it first. So don\u2019t wait too long to register their trademark. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another mistake is that people start offering their own invention and putting it out into the public without protecting it patent-wise. In terms of private label, if it\u2019s already out there and it hasn\u2019t been protected, technically nobody else should be able to protect that because if it\u2019s already in the public domain it shouldn\u2019t be able to be patented. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Complaints on Amazon<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see a lot of invalid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazonsellerslawyer.com\/amazon-complaints\/\">complaints on Amazon<\/a>. Competitors putting complaints through to you that just don\u2019t have a valid basis. If you haven\u2019t done your research before hand then you will have to scramble to determine the validity of that complaint. Do a little bit of work in the beginning because it will pay dividends further down the line when you get future complaints.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do get a complaint, Anthony recommends seeking legal counsel. With patent infringement, the burden is on the person claiming it. Every claim in the patent has to be hit for it to be an infringement. If there is one point of difference, it just doesn\u2019t apply and there\u2019s no infringement. That\u2019s the most common defense and if you get a complaint, have someone give a quick analysis to reply on those grounds (if that applies to your situation of course).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Advice for People in the UK Selling on the US Amazon Site<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are selling in on the US Amazon site and you get a complaint through there, \u00a0Anthony\u2019s advice is that you need an American lawyer. Since the sales are happening in the US and it\u2019s the Amazon US store, US law is going to apply. So you need an attorney that\u2019s qualified to interpret US law, one that\u2019s admitted to practice in the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Protecting Your Brand<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The packaging or appearance of a product\u2019s packaging can be trademarked but doesn\u2019t fall under patent law. Specifically, it\u2019s called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazonsellerslawyer.com\/blog\/trade-dress-amazon-seller\/\">Trade Dress<\/a>. It\u2019s similar to a design patent, which covers the appearance of the actual object or invention. Trademarks are used to identify the source or quality of goods, whereas Trade Dress is the visual appearance of the product or brand. Generally, packaging is part of trademark law, but it has to have secondary meaning. So you can\u2019t register a Trade Dress application until you\u2019ve already been using the product. It has to acquire secondary meaning because it\u2019s not going to identify the source of the goods or services until you\u2019re actually using it to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can register the name of something as a Trademark before you use it. However, if you were going to try to <a href=\"https:\/\/brandservices.amazon.com\/\">protect the packaging with the image or any particular color schemes<\/a>, you can\u2019t register that until you\u2019ve used it and developed that secondary meaning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you do get the rights to intellectual property on first use, you still need to register it to protect it further and save yourself time and hassle down the track. If someone shows up and starts using your mark, and you have the registration documentation, then you can just submit it to Amazon without the burden of having to prove and defend it. Having the USPTO registration makes it easier and simpler to police your brand. Plus, many websites, Amazon included, often won\u2019t act until you have that documentation so it\u2019s worth it to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Costs Involved with Registering Trademarks for Amazon<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to register your mark for each class of goods that you want to protect. That\u2019s where it can start to get expensive. In some cases, you will need to register your trademarks for Amazon in several classes. Each class has its own filing fee. It\u2019s approximately $250 per class. You will pay more or less depending on how many classes of goods you think you need to register for. You can get more protection on use but even if you start and register just one class it can potentially offer you more protection if you expand into other products down the line. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Future Trends of Intellectual Property in the FBA World<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony predicts that it\u2019s going to become more prevalent to hear about and have to be educated about the various intellectual property rights, responsibilities, and trademarks for Amazon. Private labeling is the future and people are going to need to be savvy in order to go ahead with their businesses and be protected. It will be much more important and at the very least there will be an increase in trademark registrations. On both sides, we\u2019ll see more registrations and more complaints, which is a natural byproduct of it becoming more prevalent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that Amazon is very quick to shoot first and ask questions later. So anything you can do to make that process of getting your products reinstated as quick and easy as possible is really worth it. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>General Advice<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthony\u2019s main advice for sellers is to self-educate about trademarks for Amazon. There are lots of resources even just on the <a href=\"http:\/\/uspto.gov\">USPTO<\/a> site. You have to know what you\u2019re dealing with. Then you can know the base information, and know enough to spot issues, so you know what you need to consult an expert on. \u00a0After that, do a clearance search for your own private label brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_127\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=127\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Trademarks for Amazon Private Label Sellers Part 2 of 2<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221;
