Let&#8217;s deal with that today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having previously bought various properties, I&#8217;m now considering selling one A selling or buying decision around any asset, including property, or a business is a lot of the same sort of thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re buying an asset or selling an asset, which has a capital value, and then it will, if it works well, generate cashflow, sometimes negative if you get it wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So should you be led by the numbers?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been on a train with a Google sheet, working out the capital gains of selling a residential property versus keeping it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s interesting is how one arrives at decisions in business the nice thing about business is numbers guide you. Should they lead you? Should they guide you? Should you ignore them?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take one extreme at a time and examine how it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thesis: Ignore numbers (go with your gut)<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Extreme number one is to ignore the numbers and go with your guts, follow your intuition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a difference, between your guts and immediate instinct.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Instinctive reaction to pain causes short-term decisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Running a business or owning property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can be painful. , there&#8217;s legal liability people hassling you, spending your own money and time and regulations always increasing. Both in business and residential property. My experience in the uk, Amazon selling is not getting any less full of regulations particularly if you sell in the eu or you know, if you&#8217;re looking at Amazon&#8217;s legal changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so gut reaction might be just sell the damn thing because it&#8217;s painful, but anything worthwhile can be painful. That&#8217;s probably not a good plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, what about intuition? If your intuition says, it&#8217;s hard work, but the pain is not worth the gain. You might be right. Intuition can, misguide us because we overrate immediate pain and underwrite future pain. So if we do something now that makes them the easy but cost you a lot of pain in the future, that&#8217;s not a very rational way of making decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pure instinct or intuition has its dangers. So in the pure form, probably unwise, although one should not ignore one&#8217;s intuition as an entrepreneur, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Antithesis: Being led purely by the numbers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s version two, led by the numbers, not guided by the numbers, but just led by them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The classic example of that mistake is in the the lockdown period or just after that, a lot of aggregators, private equity companies with a lot of money went out shopping for e commerce businesses based on Amazon. They made multiple mistakes, but one of them was based simply on following the numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of very smart people, many of whom I interviewed for the podcast at the time, were involved in that, but they didn&#8217;t have Amazon common sense or e commerce common sense they were good at, number analysis. So they analyzed the numbers but what they didn&#8217;t take out was any kind of common sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why did the aggregators get it wrong in 2021-22?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at the root cause of the massive increase in revenue and profits of e commerce businesses around 2019, 2020, was obvious. The pandemic and lockdowns particularly in the UK and US. Were extreme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was in the UK at the time, so yeah, that is in retrospect, I guess, very obvious what was, was going on there. Even at the time it wasn&#8217;t rocket science to think there would be some kind of aversion to shopping in a physical location after the Pandemic, how much was going to be hard to call, but it wouldn&#8217;t be zero. And there was going to be some reversion to spending discretionary earnings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So consumer spending, you could spend on whatever that isn&#8217;t just your rent or mortgage on some services such as entertainment, going out to pubs. Technically they&#8217;re buying products, but they&#8217;re kind of consuming them immediately. So it&#8217;s kind of a service or other services like going to the cinema or going out to see a football game or whatever it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in the end they overvalued those businesses, I think in part because they just followed the numbers without giving any thought to what the root cause driving the numbers I think the classic mistake with that is to believe in the numbers as a value in themselves, as opposed to seeing them as a proxy for things you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So numbers on a business are a proxy for the value of a business. Which is kind of a quantitative thing when you sell it, but it&#8217;s kind of a qualitative thing. I mean, if you buy a Mercedes, you pay more for it than you would for a Toyota. But why is that? You can put numbers on it, but in the end, it&#8217;s a qualitative decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly, it&#8217;s a consumer product, so that&#8217;s very much a feeling of quality. But it&#8217;s also true, I think, for businesses as well. Ignoring intuition and ignoring root causes are both risky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Synthesis: Be guided by the numbers and your gut<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s the solution? Well, guess what? It&#8217;s that old Hegelian thing if you&#8217;re into your German philosophers, which I doubt you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are, then Hegel a guy who one of many thinkers in the 19th century from Germany. He was big on the idea of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. It sounds very posh and abstract, but it&#8217;s pretty simple. Thesis is the starting point. Antithesis is the opposite of that. Synthesis is putting them together, putting them, you know, what&#8217;s the end result when you melt them together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think it&#8217;s obvious yet easy to get wrong you need both the numbers and your intuition. A classic beginner entrepreneur or small business owner behavior is to be led by instinct and intuition and just sell things or buy things because they seem exciting or disappointing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more grown up, sophisticated error, but nevertheless still an error, and sometimes a very big one, is that you follow the numbers blindly. The even bigger error linked with that is you think you know what you&#8217;re doing, but you don&#8217;t. If you don&#8217;t do any analysis, you know damn well that you haven&#8217;t analysed things, you don&#8217;t know what the numbers are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve done analysis, and got it wrong, you think You know what&#8217;s going on and don&#8217;t. So you might make more drastic decisions based on your confidence in your analysis. And that is really dangerous. Thinking you&#8217;re right when you&#8217;re not. Or having excessive certainty. Is not good. The solution is to use both common sense and intuition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Remember first principles<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I say common sense, I should add one final thought, which is a sort of synthesis of a third element that we haven&#8217;t discussed, which is root causes or first principles thinking. If the pandemic locking down everyone at home is driving the behavior of them shopping online all the time, then you know that going to be change to that behavior when the root cause of the pandemic lockdown happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were, looking at analyzing e commerce businesses in, 2021 that has to be part of the picture for example, looking at residential property, I&#8217;m not just looking at the current tax and, legal regime, but where it&#8217;s going and it doesn&#8217;t look highly attractive for me in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Amazon sellers are seeing the same thing. They&#8217;re looking at the trends, not just the historical numbers but the probable trends in the future and what&#8217;s driving that well. And just as wish to give shareholders. a reason to buy Amazon stock rather than sell it and to increase the share price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that used to be all about growth of Amazon and the future income and the future cashflow for many years. And now it&#8217;s becoming need to get paid now. You know, so Amazon is showing a bit more profit. They&#8217;re not actually paying dividends by the way. That is one example of root cause thinking when considering to divest or invest,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>should you sell them off for profit? Or even at a loss just to take the loss or should you invest in things? That could be true at the product level. Business level. And business model level as well. So. residential real estate or property maybe become quite unattractive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Property as a whole, as an asset class or residential property, maybe not, but real estate might be that the different sector, for example, commercial property could still be attractive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This applies at all levels but it&#8217;s important a framework for how you make decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that some of greatest investors such as Warren Buffett&#8217;s late partner Charlie Munger had such mental models, so I think it&#8217;s important to think this through before you then plunge into the minutiae of every decision. Hope that helps.
