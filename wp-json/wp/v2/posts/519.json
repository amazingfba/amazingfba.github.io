He wants a handful under 250 reviews. They\u2019ve probably been there under a year, so there\u2019s room for AL to take some market share. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He\u2019ll glance at BSR &#8211; a number between 2000-4000 =mid competition. Anthony is confident he can easily get on page 1. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">80% of all factories in the world are in China &#8211; it has lots of real estate, dedicated to factories. Everything AL sources is located in China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Next step is to find a supplier using Alibaba, Global Sources,. Global sources is his go to place. HK is an easy place to reach and many of their suppliers go to their trade show. HKDTC (never had much success so far) and Made in China as backups. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Criteria: Gold Supplier for 3 years &#8211; they have to pay for that. Make sure they take some kind of secure payment -they\u2019re probably not trying to rip people off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Send out your enquiry. Ask for samples first &#8211; if it\u2019s crap, cost doesn\u2019t matter! 3-4 samples generally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You pare down &#8211; send emails. certain %age come back; ask for samples; certain %age respond. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whittle down to highest quality then<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>pit them against each other for quotes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI really like your quality and I personally would like to work with you. But my partners would like to work with your rivals because of price.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">ALWAYS make custom modifications. Put logo on product not just package, have the product itself your brand colours. Better for brand and for hijackers etc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Give them design specs, place a 30% deposit but have them send you a sample of your design. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Use that to check quality and for photos. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you deal with Quality control?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Have an inspection co. like Asianinspection or Richforth. Contract them for a man day (unless it\u2019s electronic in which case you might need a week) 300 USD for one man day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Have it set against a margin of error. So you know it\u2019s good to go before you leave the factory. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You tell the factory they won\u2019t get 70%<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can work with a sourcing agent. It\u2019s just hard to find someone you can trust. Most of them are very much making a deal with the factory and you. Get paid on the front end and the back end. It turns out AL has 15 years\u2019 experience as an importer and AL is now communicating with him. That will help with QC &#8211; they can check factory, batch inspection. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The real low tech way\/cheap way to do it &#8211; find someone on Upwork to go to the factory and send a Skype video or pictures of the production line or products. Have them toggle switches etc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What are the biggest issues you\u2019ve met with suppliers? What are your best solutions?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">AL has been \u201clucky\u201d but that\u2019s because he has a lot of hoops to jump through before he\u2019l work with them. He\u2019s heard the horror story e.g. sample quality not real quality or jack up prices last minute etc. Not experienced yet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The best way is to very very thorough about selection process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What other hoops do you make them jump through?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Communication. How responsive are they? If it takes 2 days to get an email back, am I a priority? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When we get to a certain point, what\u2019s your Skype? how about your mobile\/cell phone?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I have them send pictures of the production facility. Because<\/span><\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">see the factory. 2. How willing are they to do it?<br \/>\nThe factory is your biz partner &#8211; they\u2019d better act like it! If you were gong into<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>biz with someone in your own country how you would you want them to act?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you handle freight? Supplier\u2019s carrier?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you deal with inventory management?<\/b><br \/>\nIt\u2019s a big area of confusion! AL does not have a courier account with DHL etc. because he doesn\u2019t do much air freight. He just uses supplier\u2019s courier account for samples &#8211; he<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>even has a standard template for samples. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For everything else he uses sea freight as it is significantly less expensive. Generally he shipped LTL (Less than a Truckload \/LCL (Less than a Container Load) although now mostly 20-40 foot containers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Because the closest US coast to China is the West coast, and the most common port is Longbeach, he specifically looked for a Freight Forwarder in LA. So that is freighting by sea and delivered the shortest distance. Then he does LTL pickup by Amazon who picks up palletized and labelled units ready to go to Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SO you\u2019re looking for a one-stop shop for warehousing and freight?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, wanted to make process as easy as possible. They contract with a customs agent to handle the customs clearance. AL just gets an email with the bill. They make it really easy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">An alternative is to use Asia based Freight Forwarders &#8211; they get amazing deals on fast boats out of China. So you need to go through the same process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Amazon decided that everything is going to Moreno CA so West Coast made sense. However, every time they have a strike, his products get stuck. The absolutely best way is to go out and get as many quotes from FF as possible. As lots of questions and get one that will take the time to educate you. One of them might say \u201cWell our clients do it this way\u201d and make a suggestion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tell us about inventory management &#8211; when a product is selling, what then? <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What about \u201cKilling off\u201d products with low sales or low profit?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">AL doesn\u2019t yet use inventory management software &#8211; doing it manually is a pain. It\u2019s tricky because you base reordering decisions on two weeks\u2019 sales; then you get a spike in sales and you will run out of stock. The other danger is demand drops off instead and you buy too much inventory so you pay high warehousing fees. That\u2019s when supply chain management evolves. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You need to look at warehousing deals so at some point you can bring in whole containers and bring<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>only a couple of pallets to Amazon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Every product is seasonal. You need to be in the game before you learn that pattern for a particular product. A store manager might be your first hire &#8211; a necessary one if you\u2019re going to have and grow a business based on importing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>When to let go of products?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A lot of people come in thinking they need to make lots of sales or it\u2019s over. If the product is still making you a profit, you should maybe reconsider. Even if it\u2019s only a small amount. If you get 5% return, it\u2019s worthwhile. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What\u2019s your approach to cashflow management? <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Al is just starting that conversation &#8211; chances are you will run into this soon enough. The solution is not in the system itself. Cash injections become important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">AL\u2019s short term solution has been credit. Will Tjernlund uses Amazon outside of PL to make cash faster &#8211; wholesaling ideas are fantastic. When you\u2019re in this business, you\u2019ll make a lot of connections. It could be someone in your local area who doesn\u2019t have product on Amazon or it\u2019s not selling well. You probably have more Amazon experience than they do. SO soft sell &#8211; let me help you with this &#8211; good way to make extra cash. AL has recently been working out profit share deals with people who want to <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Leverage whatever skills you have. A lot of people want this skill but don\u2019t have time to develop. A lot of retailers are on a 36 month contract and paying whether they make sales or not. You could come in with a solution<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>and make them extra money. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can work out a wholesale deal. You can do consulting. Whatever comes your way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Bigger picture<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What&#8217;s working well right now in your business (that you can reveal)? <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finding great margin deals by establishing relationships with factories and suppliers. Then get on page 1 for main keywords.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>AL has one<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>product only selling 2 a day which will kill it in Q4.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What are the most successful sellers you know doing right now?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One person is leveraging Facebook advertising for both Amazon and Shopify sales. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Either learn an avenue really well, or pay someone else who knows it really well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another friend takes advantage of every single offer. Every beta programme they do, she takes it. She\u2019s got someone at amazon who answers her email. She is killing it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Find an area where you can get visibility for your products and get really good at it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What do you see coming in terms of changes that we should be thinking about adapting to\u2026 In the next year?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Predictions are mostly wrong! But a focus of unique products is coming &#8211; we\u2019re in the middle of a Kickstarter crowdfunding craze. SO AL assumes that Amazon will get a lot more of untested unproven concepts coming out. This might be the next generation of sales. The marketplace has proven they like this kind of thing. There will be a lot less competition for those products. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have an idea, this will be growing, -there are prototyping companies out there, go for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the next five years, there will be other marketplaces &#8211; whatever teenage girls are doing now will become big! App based &#8211; right now, teenage girls are buying products on App based programmes like Wish etc, which are basically like eBay<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you have any parting words of advice?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The most important thing is: understand you are serving a marketplace, a niche, not just selling a product. Treat it like a business &#8211; it\u2019s an investment &#8211; go at it with a calm pulse, understand that it takes time. The growth curve is never easy, it\u2019s never in a straight line but stick with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS PODCAST<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A podcast is a free downloadable audio show that enables you to learn while you\u2019re on the go.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>To subscribe to my podcast for free, you\u2019ll need an app to listen to the show from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For iPhone\/iPad\/iPod listeners \u2013 Grab your phone or device and go to the iTunes store and search \u201cAmazing FBA\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will help you to download the free Podcasts App (produced by Apple) and then subscribe to the show from within that app.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Every time I produce a new episode, you\u2019ll get it downloaded right away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For podcast enthusiasts \u2013 If you already listen to podcasts and have a podcatcher that you prefer, the feed you\u2019ll need to add is: http:\/\/ amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who don\u2019t have a mobile device \u2013 You can always listen to the show by clicking the audio file at the top of this page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have any queries, just go to www.amazingfba.com\/ask<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Product Process Suppliers Freight And Amazon Future With Anthony Lee &#8211; Part 2<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Q_U06onkpw&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F_50_Anthony_Lee_2-auphonic.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F50-product-process-suppliers-freight-and-amazon-future-with-anthony-lee-part-2%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-2\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_50_Anthony_Lee_2-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=519-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_50_Anthony_Lee_2-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"_50_Anthony_Lee_2-auphonic.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 46:08 &#8212; 42.2MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Anthony Lee is the &#8220;anti-guru&#8221; of Amazon selling.
