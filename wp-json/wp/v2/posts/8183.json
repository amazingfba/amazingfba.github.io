They currently have\u00a0 40 team members in their 8 figure business<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>What\u2019s the starting point with\u00a0 building an ecommerce team?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">It is important in the early days to understand the process.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But frankly Fernando doesn\u2019t really document things<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">He\u2019s more people and team-oriented.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Focus on your strengths! If you\u2019re not process-driven, you can hire someone who is!<\/p>\n<p>In this case, you may start to build an ecommerce team earlier rather than automate processes with software<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>How did you start to build your ecommerce team?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">About 7 months in. It was someone in the Philippines.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It was driven by the tasks that were taking up Nick\u2019s time (Fernando\u2019s business partner) Nick was handling customer support and Fernando was aware that wasn\u2019t a great use of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>his time.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>First principle of outsourcing for Amazon: Set a value on your time<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">There are things that only owners can do<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">Financial planning<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Strategy<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Hiring<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p3\">These are all high value tasks<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">For example, finding another product that would generate $500 profit a month is a very high value task.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Gradually Increase the value you set on your time as you build your ecommerce team<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Fernando\u2019s barrier was $50 an hour value<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Because of valuing his time<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Then pushed up to $100<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Now it\u2019s around $500 per hour<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Specific tasks were possible to learn but would we do it as well and would it be fun. For example hiring a photographer!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>What to outsource first for Amazon<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">There are a lot of repeatable tasks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They have an assigned value and complexity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Simple\/lower value tasks:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">Customer support<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Admin tasks<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p3\">More complex tasks would be:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">Product development<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Sourcing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>How did you find the faith that you would produce than your ecommerce team cost?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">They outsourced at $80K USD a month revenue, which was probably a bit late. The business was profitable at that point so could easily afford the cost.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It was clear Nick could use his time better by then.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>How did you hire your 2nd team member?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">They took a step back and asked themselves<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cWhat are going to be the big levers for growth?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The answers were:<\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">Product development<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Sourcing, logistics planning<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p3\">So they were the next two hires in CA, USA<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They helped standardise the process for product development.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Fernando enjoyed this but had to fit it into his time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They would need operational support so they<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Over the years, Fernando has got a bit lazier about figuring out processes!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Most tasks and responsibilities will recur. It\u2019s better to bring someone on<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Fernando is good at getting something off the ground not in a super structured way.<\/p>\n<p>He then hands over to his team to structure and refine processes.<\/p>\n<h2>The hiring journey &#8211; how Fernando&#8217;s ecommerce team grew over time&#8230;<\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>When to Hire specialists for your Amazon team<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">You start off by hiring for potential.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Now it\u2019s much easier to bring someone in with the right background<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Next phase <\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Brought in people below team in CA and they became managers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">This is where they really started to see improvement.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It elevated the roles of the people in CA to management and let them focus on strategy and process and how to scale to 10-20M<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Early 2016 &#8211; hiring in the USA<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b>Why hire in the USA for your outsrouced team?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The people in CA had some mutual friends and good backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They didn\u2019t really know if they could hire high level people in the PH.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Nowadays they are more confident in this.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They were more focussed on hiring admin tasks overseas.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">More and more they started hiring more and more PH team members.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b>Financial struggle in 2017 &#8211; had to do layoffs<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Mid 2017 Laid off part of team in USA (from 7 to 4 inc Fernando and business partner nick) and part PH.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">There was a moment of epiphany (Agug 2017) maybe 8 peopleand they realised the people in PH with a lot of experience were way better than US. Then there was the decision to only hire overseas.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Moving from \u201cGood enough\u201d to \u201cexcellence\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They should think about them as if they were being paid $50K USD a year.<br \/>\nThat really focussed on hiring A players<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Headhunting top Filipino workers<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">They tried to grab people from big co\u2019s in Ph<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">So someone who is commuting 4 hours a day in Manila<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They place value on family so this is big<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">And also you offer them<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">More resp<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Autonomy<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Startup culture<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Team hyper-growth<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Then they got up to 15 people<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Then hired a part time recruiter and went up to 50-60 people within 12 months.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They put in managers and a proper org chart.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It was a lot of process.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">There were people they didn\u2019t need but financially it was sustainable.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They could have done a better job of automating.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Fernando Working 40 hours a week and doubling most years<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>What do you ascribe the business growth to?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">A huge part of it was the team.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It\u2019s just focussing on the right things. Fernando saw people focus on Shopify and they had a good product for Shopify eg consumable. And they can triple business in 12 months.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Others try to build Shopify with a low price point, non consumable product. They waste 8 months and come back to Amazon!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">F knows some people who have scaled in supplements but they don\u2019t really know their numbers. But their margins are so hire say 48-52% so they don\u2019t focus on that. They just focus on finding super high margin products and ranking them on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Planning your strategy is so important.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>Advice around team to scale from 7 to 8 figures<\/b><\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Biggest tip in building a team for your business<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Hire a right hand person as early as you can afford it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As soon as you can afford someone, hire someone who was a manager or director or a VP in another company. Whether Amazon or not.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">They can really speed up your development as a business.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Fernando has never run a company bigger than this. So he doesn\u2019t know what he doesn\u2019t know. So this person has\u00a0<em>really\u00a0<\/em>helped them navigate as they&#8217;ve grown.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">CEO coach &#8211; anything from 2-5K a year. Really helped.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Really good books on Scaling help too:<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Traction-Get-Grip-Your-Business\/dp\/B00A9Z973M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Traction by Gino Wickman<\/a> (Amazon USA link). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Traction-Get-Grip-Your-Business-ebook\/dp\/B007QWLLV2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon UK link here<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Scaling-Up-Mastering-Rockefeller-Habits\/dp\/0986019593\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scaling up By Verne Harnish<\/a> (Amazon USA link). <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.co.uk\/Scaling-Up-Companies-Rockefeller-Habits-ebook\/dp\/B00O5RR7QO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon UK link here<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b>Get out of the day to day low value tasks<\/b><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">Get an EA (Executive Assistant) as soon as possible<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Get meal plans delivered<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Minimise cooking or cleaning<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Automate using Zapier<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>How do people get in touch?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><a href=\"mailto:fernando@marketplaceops.com\">fernando@marketplaceops.com<\/a><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>What marketplace ops do<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Work with up and coming fast growing brands to grow on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Turnkey solution<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Strategy<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Set up Manychat funnels<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Optimize listings<\/p>\n<h3>For other interviews with Fernando by Michael:<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/scaling-an-amazon-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scaling to 8 figures in 5years on Amazon<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Other interviews on eCommerce Team building with Michael:<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/outsourcing-basics-with-nathan-hirsch-of-outsourceschool-com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Outsourcing Basics<\/a> with Nathan Hirsch<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/178-outsource-amazon-tasks-nathan-hirsch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to outsource Amazon Tasks<\/a> with Nathan Hirsch<\/p>\n<h3>Other internet resources on eCommerce Team Building<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irpcommerce.com\/en\/gb\/IRPStrategyCenter\/Building-an-Ecommerce-Team\/sc-18.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Building an eCommerce Team\u00a0<\/a> by IRP Commerce<\/p>\n<p class=\"heading c--black \">What It Takes to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.scalefast.com\/blog\/what-it-takes-to-build-an-ecommerce-team-from-scratch-and-key-roles-youll-need-to-fill\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Build an eCommerce Team From Scratch<\/a> by ScaleFast<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch my full interview with Fernando Campos<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221;
