Find the latest tactics and stay ahead of the curve?<\/p>\n<p>These sound like a pitch for the latest high-tech software, right?<\/p>\n<p>Well you&#8217;d be wrong. I&#8217;m talking about good old-fashioned face-to-face, interactive Amazon masterminds here.<\/p>\n<p>Through Amazon masterminds, I&#8217;ve personally found an amazing Amazon business partner, learnt many tactics that have made me $1000s extra, and been offered deals worth $100K+ a month of revenue.<\/p>\n<p>But let me you how I got here&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\"><b>My background with Amazon masterminds<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">First, I should give some background and confess. I\u2019ve been a member of a private Amazon mastermind of my peers (Amazon sellers) for about 18 months now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> I also set up and ran (free) peer-group Amazon mastermind meetings myself about 2 \u00bd<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>years ago, which ran for a while. That sputtered out because the people weren&#8217;t really <strong>committed<\/strong>. And I was wanting to focus on selling on Amazon, not running a mastermind for uncommitted people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I took the learnings from both Amazon masterminds and created something better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0So I\u2019ve been running a successful (modestly) paid Amazon mastermind meetings for about a year via Amazing FBA (I recently set up a <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/private-label-mastermind-zero-to-hero\/\"><span class=\"s2\">new \u00a0Amazon mastermind<\/span><\/a> for new sellers, i.e., those who haven\u2019t launched yet)<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The reality of Amazon masterminds<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">First thing: yes, of course I&#8217;m going to mention my own masterminds, at least in passing . I run two Amazon masterminds each month. I\u2019m writing an article about how important masterminds\/masterminds are. It&#8217;s bound to come up! But I&#8217;m here to share my experiences of masterminds, not to pitch my own (if you do want to read the pitch for my masterminds\/masterminds, of course, <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/zero-to-hero-application\/\">click here<\/a>!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Second thing: there&#8217;s a reason <strong>why\u00a0<\/strong>I run an Amazon \u00a0mastermind each month. Because I believe it&#8217;s one of the most powerful ways I can truly help Amazon entrepreneurs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Third thing: from everything I can observe of truly successful Amazon entrepreneurs &#8211; it\u2019s (still) true that every one of them is a member of some kind of Amazon mastermind or mastermind!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">I guess as a person who needs interaction and inspiration, I\u2019m biased. But&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Coincidence? I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>My own wins from Amazon masterminds<\/h3>\n<p>I personally have got so many results directly from being in masterminds. I&#8217;ve found an amazing Amazon \u00a0business partner; sold thousands from secret techniques shared within the closed walls of a mastermind; and been invited into strategic partnerships to do deals involving $100s of thousands in revenue.<\/p>\n<p>These results are not chance. But they equally would never have come about simply from networking on the superficial level(valuable as that is) at Amazon conferences.<\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"3462\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/amazon-masterminds-why\/work-2196609_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/work-2196609_640.jpg?fit=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 600D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;32&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.01&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"work-2196609_640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/work-2196609_640.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/work-2196609_640.jpg?fit=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3462 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/work-2196609_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Amazon Masterminds meeting\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/work-2196609_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/work-2196609_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018Amazon masterminds\u2019?\u201d<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">First, let\u2019s start of by defining our terms. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2018Amazon\u2019 as a business opportunity can be exploited by a huge variety of business models. \u00a0There could be around 14 business models, according to some authorities. That sounds about right. Certainly common ones include Retail Arbitrage; Online Arbitrage; Drop-Shipping; Wholesaling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When I say \u201cAmazon\u201d, my particular focus here (and that of the podcast\/blog and coaching programmes) is selling Private Label products via Amazon FBA. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Secondly, what are we talking about with a \u2018mastermind\u2019?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When\u00a0so-called \u201cAmazon masterminds\u201d are not really a masterminds<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I think it\u2019s almost easier to say what masterminds are not. They are NOT, as far as I\u2019m concerned, a mass meeting of 100 peo<\/span><span class=\"s1\">ple where someone from the front discusses or teaches a lesson. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Don&#8217;t get me wrong. Big meetings can be\u00a0very valuable -and by the way, Andy Geldman of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webretailer.com\/\">Webretailer<\/a> runs an excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Amazon-Sellers-London\/members\/\">London Amazon meet<\/a> up most months, where they have really helpful speakers. I\u2019ve spoken there recently and was very impressed with the setup. It\u2019s a great place to learn new strategies and tactics, and to network. But to my mind, it\u2019s not a mastermind (and nor does Andy claim it is, just to be clear!) <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Andy charges about a fiver to enter his meetings and, while I think that is super-cheap (and he could arguably charge up to \u00a350 or so), he\u2019s not charging hundreds, which I think is appropriate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I think there are various aspects of Amazon masterminds that make them unique. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Firstly, to be really powerful, they need to be very <b>interactive. <\/b>So all participants have to think hard and engage their brains in a very <i>active <\/i>way. It develops their business thinking on a deeper level. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Secondly, they need to be <b>focussed. <\/b>Generalised excitement has its place, but I would argue that place is at a larger conference-type meeting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Thirdly, they need to <b>move the participants on<\/b> in their business. How many times have you been to a large group meeting which inspired you to feel excited about business\u2026 and when you got home you did\u2026er\u2026absolutely nothing except talk about how exciting it was (it\u2019s embarrassing but we may as well<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>be honest with each other &#8211; I did that for <b><i>decades<\/i><\/b>). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I don\u2019t believe that really serves anyone long-term. I think the success of a Amazon masterminds is measured in how much <i>action <\/i>their participants produce and therefore how much <i>progress<\/i> they make towards their goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Which brings me to another question I\u2019ve been asked a few times recently:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u201cWhat extra value does this offer compared to online research? Why bother being in Amazon masterminds?\u201d<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I love this question because it so clearly illustrates a number of things. This is a really important question. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">My simple answers: Time; Certainty; Motivation; Action; Progress<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"3463\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/amazon-masterminds-why\/clock-407101_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/clock-407101_640.jpg?fit=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;14&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;105&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.005&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"clock-407101_640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/clock-407101_640.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/clock-407101_640.jpg?fit=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3463 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/clock-407101_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Amazon masterminds save time\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/clock-407101_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/clock-407101_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/private-label-mastermind-zero-to-hero\/\">Amazon masterminds<\/a> value your TIME<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Of course, since the invention of Google (and in more recent years, Facebook groups), in theory you can piece together all the knowledge you need to do anything.<br \/>\nThe problem is- reinventing the wheel takes a lot of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\nLet&#8217;s say you are researching Product Research methods.

There\u2019s obviously a lot to be gained for an unscrupulous member to exploit others\u2019 product ideas.

After a couple of months without even buying a small amount of inventory, I&#8217;m afraid that &#8220;research&#8221; is cover for &#8220;fear\/being lost&#8221;. That&#8217;s okay, honesty is useful &#8211; but why stay lost?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019ve been selling but way below what you know you\u2019ve targetted, again, that\u2019s just called being human. But if you do nothing new about it, nothing changes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Being with human beings is hardwired into us. We&#8217;re group animals.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It should therefore be no surprise that your peer group (who you hang out with most of the time and compare yourself to) has a <b>massive <\/b>impact on everything about you.

And, of course, your wealth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Getting yourself a peer group and stay actually excited instead of being isolated behind your laptop is simply following fundamental principles of human (indeed, primate) social psychology. We violate those principles\u00a0at our risk. Why fight nature?
