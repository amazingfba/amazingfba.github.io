You don\u2019t have to worry about the various paperwork, custom claims, etc. This is a skill these guys have been working on for years, they can do it better and more efficiently than you, so let them do it. UPS is around <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">\u00a3<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">11 per shipment for customs clearance. DHL is right around there as are most of the others. Since you\u2019re importing the product, most of the paperwork is done by the exporter and you\u2019ll end up with the VAT and the duty. Both of these are calculate off the commercial invoice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">One thing the Chinese like to do to be nice, is send the shipment as samples. If they are a sample, that\u2019s fine. However, if you\u2019re shipment is 500 units, that clearly isn\u2019t a sample. At some point, the guys at HMRC are going to catch on and you may end up with penalties as well as your future shipments getting more scrutiny causing delays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">You have a proper business, so you want to make sure you do things by the book. It may cost you more in duties, but you want to build your business on solid ground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Another they offer is to lower the cost of the invoice to stay under a certain value at which point things become more complicated. Is that something to avoid as well?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">At the end of the day you\u2019re evading taxes, which simply put, is wrong. Also, if you get caught you may end up getting put on a list which will further delay you in the future. If one of the customs officials gets to digging around and realizes your products are valued at more than what was declared, they will put you on a watchlist. Ongoing shipments will be inspected and paperwork will be scrutinized which will hold up your shipment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Do you need to instruct your suppliers about commercial invoices or will that be checked by DHL or UPS?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">A commercial invoice is just like any other invoice. It will detail the value of what your purchased, the goods you purchased, the delivery address, the importer on record\u2019s address, and the commodity code. That is a global code that details what the product is classified as which you can find on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/trade-tariff\/sections\">HMRC<\/a> website. So when the shipment comes in they can charge import duties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Is that something the Chinese supplier will automatically put on the invoice and get right?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Well\u2026 they\u2019ll put it on the invoice. It may not always be right and there is no way of going back and saying this is wrong, so you\u2019ll just have to double-check it and next time you order tell your supplier that they put the wrong commodity code on it. Which could save yourself some money since the import duties can vary depending on this code. It can range from 0-12% on top of VAT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">How is VAT calculated? Is it the value of the goods only?<\/span> <span lang=\"en-US\">So if I have 500 units that cost $2 a piece, is VAT calculated on that $1000?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is the commercial invoice value + freight + duty. VAT is calculated on the total of all three.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is there anything else we need to get on the commercial invoice? Say I order a shipment, sent to your prep company, do I need to make sure all that is on the invoice and how do I communicate that to DHL or whoever?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It does need to be on there, but in Greg\u2019s experience if doesn\u2019t matter. It seems to be a daily battle with FedEx, or DHL trying to get the person on the commercial invoice or airway bill. It doesn\u2019t matte who the consignee is, Greg seems to always get the bill sent to FBA Pep UK at his address. If you look at the paperwork that comes with it, it clearly states the correct customer but they seem to ignore that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you handle that, when you get the invoice in stead of your customer?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It depends on the customer. Some will just pay it which is fine. Even though it\u2019s FBA Prep UK on the bill, they can\u2019t sort it out. The customer has to contact them and tell them that they will accept that invoice.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">The biggest takeaway seems to be that it\u2019s best to just use a freight forwarder or use your courier and make sure that your name and the company name is on the paperwork.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Those guys are the professionals. They are doing this day in and day out. Sure you can learn it, but that\u2019s time better spend on your company and sourcing more profitable products.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Another thing you have to worry about is your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/eori-supporting-guidance\">EORI<\/a> (Economic Operator Registration and Identification scheme) number. Which is a number supplied by the HMRC (Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs). You can\u2019t apply for one unless you have a shipment coming, and you can\u2019t get your shipment into Europe until you have it. It takes about 3 or 4 days to get it, so as soon as your supplier gives you all the detail on when the shipment is coming from, where it\u2019s going to land, the size of it, the vessel number, take that information and you can<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/eori-supporting-guidance\"> apply for your EORI number online<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Small samples should be ok, your couriers can take care of it. Once you start getting bigger shipments coming in, you\u2019ll want to get your own number. It simply for statistical purposes of what come in and goes out of Europe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">On a side not, outsourcing is vital! It\u2019s a waste of time trying to do everything yourself. Some of the simpler tasks, or task that need expertise can be outsourced freeing you up to focus on growing your business. Here is just one example:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">This is a 15&#215;15 grid of everything that needs to be done <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">with products. This is why you shouldn\u2019t order 15 different things from AliExpress and why you need help with prep.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">For more ambitious sellers what are the biggest challenges <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">when trying to scale up<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">What about people who want to import a lot of one product?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Factoring time scales. If <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">your<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"> coming by air now, you\u2019re looking at 7-10 days <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">from China to yours or your prep company\u2019s hands.<\/span> <span lang=\"en-US\">As you scale up you\u2019ll have to start coming by sea which is about 35 days from China to the UK. Then the ship has to be unpacked which is another 5 days. It\u2019s about 40 days from the time the supplier delivers it to the time you take delivery. Obviously, this is something you have to consider. If you\u2019re doing you analysis to determine when you will need more product, you\u2019ll have to add another 30-40 days onto that or risk running out by the time the ship arrives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"en-US\">If you\u2019re used to doing your own prep, as you scale up the deliveries will get bigger. You\u2019ll start getting them in pallets rather than loose boxes. If you plan on continuing to do it at home, you have to consider how you\u2019re going to offload the truck. It\u2019s no longer going to be a van or small truck, it\u2019ll be <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">coming in artics<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"> so access becomes an issue. Also, you have to request a truck with a taillift if you don\u2019t have a forklift. That will cost another <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">\u00a3<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">40.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">What about those who want to go from a few SKUs to say 10 or 20 but not a huge quantity of each one?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"en-US\">This is common with things like pencils. Where you have one type of product, but 5 or 10 variations. i.e. different colors which Amazon treats as completely different products. Having the product description on the boxes is a huge help. That way if there is a problem with a particular SKU, it\u2019s easier to identify which ones they are without having to open every box.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Whether you\u2019re ordering 500 unit of one product, or 50 units of 10, the challenges are the same. Where the challenges would come and the cost would rise, is if your importing products from different suppliers. Now, there are services that will consolidate for you. You can have four or five different suppliers send everything to these consolidation <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">warehouses. They will consolidate those and export them as one shipment saving you money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">What do you see coming up in the Prep side of Amazon as a problem?<\/span> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Amazon will start requesting detailed contents of boxes. You can do it now, as an option, and in the US they have started requiring it. Usually if it happens in the US it will happen in the UK. So you will have to communicate that with your supplies to be more clear about what\u2019s in each box especially of you ship directly. They will also requiring packing notes, so when they open the box, they know what\u2019s in it to speed things up on their end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Brexit will likely have an impact on shipping in Europe. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Amazon announce recently that they will have an air fleet of about 40 planes to ship products themselves. It\u2019s unknown if freight will change much since it\u2019s a fairly stable and established system. However, Amazon will likely try to takeover that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">H<\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">ow can people get hold of you?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FBAPrep-UK-Ltd-1466291916984790\/\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Facebook Group<br \/>\n<\/span><\/a><span lang=\"en-US\">Email: g<a href=\"mailto:greag@fbaprepuk.com\">reg@fbaprepuk.com<br \/>\n<\/a><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/fbaprepuk.com\/contact-us\/\"><span lang=\"en-US\">FBAPrepUK.com<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Prep &#038; Freight to UK with Greg Jones of FBA Prep UK<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=82gERIFNEB0&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F_80_How_to_prep_for_Amazon_UK_with_Greg_Jones_-_Part_2.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F80-how-to-prep-for-amazon-uk-with-greg-jones-part-2%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_80_How_to_prep_for_Amazon_UK_with_Greg_Jones_-_Part_2.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=755-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_80_How_to_prep_for_Amazon_UK_with_Greg_Jones_-_Part_2.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"_80_How_to_prep_for_Amazon_UK_with_Greg_Jones_-_Part_2.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 27:50 &#8212; 27.9MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 27:50 &#8212; 27.9MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSWhat are the major freight paperwork and how do we overcome those?
