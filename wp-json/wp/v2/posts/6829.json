The question is whether they are really worth investigating and using.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\">What are Chatbots?<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\">They are like instant messaging meets automated email marketing (email autoresponders).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Facebook wants Messenger to be the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-is-the-difference-between-WeChat-and-WhatsApp\"><span class=\"s1\">WeChat<\/span><\/a> of the west<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Facebook Messenger has currently around an <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/open-rates-facebook-messenger\/\">80% open rate<\/a><\/span> because most businesses are not using it yet. But this will probably change as more marketers spam the system!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">It kills email in open rate, at about 20% open rate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Also as Paul is a former maths teacher &#8211; not into spelling and grammar &#8211; but can create 50-60 word message easily and quickly, compared to a complex sales email.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>WeChat<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Any Amazon seller who has been to China will have used it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">You can use it to make payments or book a cab.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">You can send payments etc. you don\u2019t need to carry cash<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Facebook wants Messenger to become a platform<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li4\">Buy things<\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Give money to friends<\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\">Communicate<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p4\">Facebook bought out WhatsApp; they own Instagram<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">In fact, 3 of the 4 top social media platforms are owned by Facebook.

Now it&#8217;s messaging.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>Where do you use Chatbots for Amazon?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\">Let\u2019s say you\u2019re launching a product &#8211; 2-3 months of samples, revisions, sourcing, then you ship it out.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">This is what you\u2019ve done on a bucket load of money. But now it\u2019s on Amazon and you\u2019ve done zero marketing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">You sign up to Manychat, you run ads on FaceBook with big discount and send users to buy on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">That is the launch!<\/p>\n<h3>Downsides of last-minute Amazon launches with Chatbots<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\">But consider: this is to a cold audience! The amazon seller spent months sourcing but they did a poor job of launch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">It\u2019s interruption marketing &#8211; people go to FaceBook to gossip, not to buy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">SO that means 1. High ad cost; 2.

This is your host, Michael Veazey. With episodes like 341 we&#8217;ve been around just about four years now. So you&#8217;ll have to have a four year celebration soon. delighted to welcome an old friend to the show who I know probably least three years really seriously experienced amazon seller, but unlike a lot of the blowhards, really a very down to earth guy, but seriously competent, and really doing some amazing stuff. And that man is Paul Harvey of seller. chatbot. So Paul, welcome back to the show.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 0:50<br \/>\nThank you, Michael, thanks for that intro.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Veazey 0:52<br \/>\nYeah, man. Well, we know between us without mentioning names that you are the brains behind some of the rather. So we say more extra people out there selling people into what they should be doing that actually, that&#8217;s pretty much your idea. So I know. That&#8217;s how, yeah, I&#8217;ll say you. You are, you know, one of the seriously brainy people in this situation out there. I know that you had a background as a math teacher, mathematician. So I guess that would explain why you&#8217;re bright, but also a bit more humble, which is great. This suits us. So let&#8217;s talk about solo chatbot. So there&#8217;s lots of success been happening recently suggest, just remind us a quick reminder for those who&#8217;ve been living under a rock. What chatbot is and why what a chat bot is and why it matters to people who sell Amazon, or indeed ecommerce, generally,<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 1:40<br \/>\nyes, or pretty much right. a chatbot is essentially email mixed with SMS, that&#8217;s all it is, is that Facebook is pushing messenger hard. They want messenger to be their WeChat of the West, they want to be really, really big. And for that to happen, basically have to spend a lot of money promoting messenger as great because right now messenger has an 80% open rates. So that means if I send you a message now on messenger, you&#8217;re going to open it because most often it&#8217;s going to be a friend. It&#8217;s not me businesses are using messenger as a as a portal. Yes. And that&#8217;s great. Because right now, we can just use that crazy good open rate and just get fans and marketing center customers. And it kills email, email has a good list as like 20%, open rates, and messenger is over 80. So that&#8217;s why the water detector right now, and also is that me being a former math teacher, English is not my thing. And if anyone&#8217;s receiving an email for me, I must apologize. My spelling and grammar is horrific. And it&#8217;s pretty because I&#8217;m a math teacher and I struggle to create long, lengthy emails. But I can easily create like a 5060 word message to my subscribers on messenger. And it takes 10 minutes. But ours and Mexico marketing that much easier.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Veazey 3:04<br \/>\nExit Well, there&#8217;s a very good reasons and I think actually, yeah, think about it. Yes, that the open rate of about 20%. If you got a decent list, that&#8217;s about what I get on my list. And I suppose I&#8217;m a words person, I&#8217;m happy writing long emails, but there&#8217;s difference between I&#8217;m happy writing long years, which I think writing email marketing, email marketing can be very, very effective. But it&#8217;s hard to do. Well, people every so often not get around a book group long, we&#8217;ve been agreed for where we&#8217;ve had some discussions catch you by email, and people are like, Oh, can I hire a VA in the Philippines to do blah, blah, blah. And the one person who&#8217;s actually done it seriously says yes, well, we spent $30,000 on and getting it written because the truth is, to do emails really well, you either have to hire a copywriter, or train yourself to be a good copywriter, which is not easy. And I managed to get sales through emails, but it&#8217;s hard. And also just because I like writing a long form email doesn&#8217;t make people like receiving it. So I think that the speed of transactions that people are used to now through SMS marketing and chatbot, and IM and all the other types of things are, you know, it fits with modern rhythms of communication. So and also you can&#8217;t argue with 80% open rate, as you said, That&#8217;s why the extraordinary. So just let you mentioned we the WeChat of the West. So for those who aren&#8217;t familiar with WeChat, or the power of it, which may be more people are familiar with it, but don&#8217;t really realize what&#8217;s under the hood, or what the potential is, tell us a bit about VJ.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 4:24<br \/>\nSo pretty much any amazon seller that&#8217;s been to China on a sourcing trip or just been to China, for that matter has used we chat, we chat is their platform. And so their app they use in China to chat to everyone to make payments to book a cab. People don&#8217;t get people don&#8217;t need to carry cash because they can just carry the WeChat app, they can send transfers, or many they can do whatever they want, they can do pretty much run everything by using the WeChat app. And that&#8217;s what messenger ones, because the whole Chinese market users we chat in our messenger, Facebook wants messenger to be the WeChat of the web. So they went messengers to become a platform. We talked to your friends, chat to businesses, make payments, Boss stuff, give me two friends, everything the people went Facebook one messenger to be that effective. And if you look at the if you look at the history, Facebook has bought out what&#8217;s up, they own Instagram, the top four, I think the top four social media platforms are owned by three of the top four owned by Facebook, and Facebook and a conglomerate of them now since they&#8217;ve said is that soon they&#8217;re gonna they&#8217;re going to join combined. What&#8217;s up, and Instagram and messenger. So you have three platforms all working from one. And that&#8217;s Facebook&#8217;s plan, because once they have that, that&#8217;s a big deal. Unless I think about this. Who is Amazon&#8217;s biggest competitor, it&#8217;s going to be Facebook. Because Facebook has five times the accent, I think I think it&#8217;s lost my head was five, I could be wrong. But Facebook has five times the user base that Amazon has. And as soon as Facebook, start offering payment services, you can buy products in the marketplace, and they stream on the whole process. If your credit card details on Facebook, you can just buy anything you want a junk fat, which means then that&#8217;s there&#8217;ll be a big competitor to Amazon because other customer base. I mean, it&#8217;s still a while away from that, but that&#8217;s what Facebook wants.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Veazey 6:27<br \/>\nAnd and the thing is that also they they have the resources, they have the programming capability, they have, as you said, the exposure, they&#8217;ve got the I don&#8217;t know, things like the lawyers to deal with the US government, which is after you know, and every so often I mean dealing with governments is is something that seems like a sort of sideshow until it isn&#8217;t I mean, Amazon has dealt very effectively to an extraordinary degree with avoiding sales tax for about two and a half decades. And finally the chickens come home to roost on that. And Facebook has been out at you know, talking to the Congress. And it seems like Congress actually this time around, have a clue about what the hell they do is they didn&#8217;t seem to have lost time. So but the point is, you know, you&#8217;ve got to have the capability to deal with all this stuff. But Facebook has that. So it&#8217;s a realistic play that they will actually take things off as powerful and entity as Amazon. But also, yeah, the WeChat thing is amazing, isn&#8217;t it? So it&#8217;s really, it&#8217;s like the opposite thing I was talking with somebody else can arc who is instantly is from the Indian subcontinent originally, and works with people to try and sort of aggregate people from that area. And what&#8217;s really interesting is that in the developing countries, instead of software specializing a lot like the social media, and then there&#8217;s ecommerce, and then as you know, wonderful computer gadgets like Amazon, and apple and Facebook is basically everything in one gadget. And that is really, I guess, now the developing world that I in China with WeChat is giving the model that the western company however giant it is, and Facebook is copying, right. So this, I think it&#8217;s an extraordinary development. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty big. I mean, he<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 8:00<br \/>\nme right now, I&#8217;m calling you from South Africa. And whenever we are on Africa, nothing people have Facebook, but they all have WhatsApp.<\/p>\n<p>Unknown Speaker 8:12<br \/>\nif you ever go back a few years now, Blackberry was huge in Africa, because of BBN the incident notifications. So people will have a in Africa, people just have a blackberry phones, they can just message all their friends for free. That&#8217;s essentially now what what&#8217;s up has become. And that&#8217;s why Africa WhatsApp is just so huge really, really is because use WhatsApp, everything I mean, here in but here local businesses, they give you their WhatsApp number, not their direct number. Because it&#8217;s free and makes makes life easier.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Veazey 8:45<br \/>\nThat&#8217;s amazing. And that&#8217;s this, it we&#8217;re starting to see instead of Silicon Valley being the place where the trends are starting, we&#8217;re starting to see trends that are working in developing countries. And they&#8217;re starting to come back to West which just it makes sense because the power, power and to some degree, military powers are shifting over the economic power is shifting partly because of sheer factor of population, right. But the economic power is one thing the military power starting to shifting to China in terms of the balance of power in the world. This may sound a bit General, but okay, what the hell is this got to do with it. So we want to plunge into that. However, I always like to place things inside a bigger context, because first of all, I&#8217;m interested. But secondly, I think if you see long term big global trends, and you pop on that trend, it&#8217;s not likely to get reversed in a few years time, which is always good if you&#8217;re building a serious business, right. And this trend towards First of all, consolidating everything becoming everyone&#8217;s starting to do everything has to do with Amazon agencies. But it&#8217;s also true with the big players, Facebook, Amazon, apple, they&#8217;re all starting to converge on the same place. And everyone&#8217;s getting into e commerce apart from the house. And secondly, this kind of consolidation into one thing, that&#8217;s a trend that&#8217;s going to be really strong to follow. So you&#8217;re safe to keep following it as a person selling on e commerce, whether Amazon starts to lose market share to Facebook or not. chat bots are going to be part of the strategy that&#8217;s going to be huge. So let&#8217;s talk about let&#8217;s talk about how we actually use it and coming down to brass tacks then of I&#8217;m an Amazon seller.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Veazey 10:11<br \/>\nOkay, I&#8217;ve got a new product coming up. I&#8217;ve heard about this chat bot thing. I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s good for launches, but how to actually use it in a, in a practical way.<\/p>\n<p>Unknown Speaker 10:23<br \/>\nSo good question. And actually, there&#8217;s two, there&#8217;s two answers to that. Now, let&#8217;s say you are launching a product, right? You go through about two, three months of hard work sourcing it from China, you go through so many samples and revisions, everything and you finally get it shipped out and arrives in Amazon, and you&#8217;re good to go. Now, this is the part that really annoys me, you&#8217;ve spent like three months, three, four months in a bucket of money, making this product amazing, which is great. But now it&#8217;s Robin Amazon and you&#8217;ve done zero marketing. And unfortunately, this is the case for most Amazon sellers. So what they do now, they&#8217;ve heard of this thing called chatbots. There was sign up too many chat or sample course, whichever is some templates. And they will run some Facebook ads that send the user to the chat box in the chat box. The reason they use chatbot is purely because open rates better and present to an email and really where people don&#8217;t really read emails. So chatbot works because of the crazy open rates. So they create an ad on Facebook, where the user sees a product for big discounts. They click on it, and they get the discounts and so on, so forth. And then they give some instructions to go about Amazon. That&#8217;s it. So that&#8217;s your launch. But consider this now. This customer was sorry, this Amazon said that what they&#8217;ve done is they&#8217;ve spent their months and months and loads of money sourcing this product. And not a Rob&#8217;s Amazon, they do a launch. But what they&#8217;ve done now is they create a Facebook ad, and they send it to a cold audience. because no one&#8217;s heard of this brand. No one&#8217;s heard of this product. Now I have to make some marketing and Facebook advertising has to be disruptive, disruptive. So what I mean by that is when someone sees an ad, on their newsfeed, they don&#8217;t take action. People don&#8217;t go to Facebook to Buster to go to Facebook to gossip. So you have an offer that&#8217;s so good at it disrupts their thought patterns, kinetic action, and the end. And unfortunately, to disrupt someone&#8217;s thought pattern when they are no no Have you requires two things, or a high ad cost and a big discounts. I mean, if I see a product job never even heard about for 20% discounts, I wouldn&#8217;t even remember it To be honest, give us that same product for 80% of our take action. And that&#8217;s it people don&#8217;t understand is that now because they&#8217;ve done zero marketing, they&#8217;ve launched their product, and they&#8217;re paying ridiculously high ad costs. And they paint and they even making more little more than last was doing a bigger discount is the two factors that could easily be avoided. If they spend maybe two, three weeks before launching, doing a pre launch, that means is creating a Facebook ad telling people that you will be launching soon as going to be a big discount for them or whichever how it works. And then when you do launch, just reach out to the list you already booked and say guys, we love check it out, here&#8217;s your discount, or here&#8217;s what offered you Whatever it is, and you will see your ad costs your would diminish, and your discount will diminish because people are aware of you, you&#8217;d have to give them an 80% discount. So I know it&#8217;s a really long answer. But it&#8217;s when you look at the two angles there. People don&#8217;t do marketing. And then they rushed and do it last minute. And people that do marketing and they do a pre launch, like two or three weeks of just basic, basic Facebook ads, which is like you can send an ad up and just leave it two weeks. That&#8217;s it. And that&#8217;s much cheaper than actually just going straight for the kill.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Veazey 13:53<br \/>\nThis is really smart. I&#8217;m actually it sounds really well you say Oh, well. So to give the long answer, I think it&#8217;s fantastic. Because I haven&#8217;t really heard any when say this, which sounds really obvious as soon as you articulate it, but it wasn&#8217;t obvious before, which is always a sign of a good bit of wisdom is like, Okay, so this makes total sense. And the fact that it costs a lot less is really obviously very, very good. Tell us how you go about this, obviously can&#8217;t give them chapter and verse on Facebook advertising but when I say that I&#8217;m obviously you&#8217;re quite versed in Facebook advertising, because it ties in very well with your chatbot. I mean, is Facebook advertising, training, something that you offer as part of what you do out of interest.<\/p>\n<p>Unknown Speaker 14:31<br \/>\nSo actually, now this is a good point, right? So what people have to use is an arm Our lives are chatbot is my platform I used a lot. However, people need to be aware that whether they use the chatbots chat, Matic chat fuel, many chat, it doesn&#8217;t matter which platform they use, these platforms are purely the vehicle.And the destination is the same no matter what vehicle you use.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 14:56<br \/>\nSo now if you&#8217;re using a platform, whichever platform that&#8217;s great, actually, the whole process is running, creating Facebook ad campaigns that plug into your chat box, because once your top box set up, it&#8217;s set up, but that&#8217;s the thing. That&#8217;s it, there&#8217;s not there&#8217;s no real way there&#8217;s a skill to making chatbots. There is. But I mean is that the real skill is actually Facebook ads. Because essentially, if you sending a product that&#8217;s a piece of junk really doesn&#8217;t matter how good your flow is not going to work. But every almost every piece of junk does have an audience on Facebook and finding an audience<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 15:30<br \/>\n.So now what people need to do is basically what they should do is this, before they launched a product, I normally say I spend about two to six weeks pre launch. And actually sometimes that&#8217;s too long, maybe I&#8217;ll just do two or three weeks. But the two or three weeks what I do is this is that this is the part where I went to fail. I really do mean that the pre launch you want to fail. What I mean by that is think of who is your ideal customer? Where do they hang out at what do they do? What are their interests, and just like spitball, some ideas. And then we you&#8217;ll come across some assumptions. You create 10 types of personas, 10 types of avatars, the customer, maybe my example, I will say I&#8217;m selling a baby blanket. So my one user base is mothers that on new mothers, they have a kid and the age of two are interested in let&#8217;s say a Pampers Babies R Us everything. The next avatar will be woman interested in charity, or the actual woman that interested in activities that help your baby sleep better, maybe baby&#8217;s asleep better, but nice baby blanket, I don&#8217;t know that assumption. But basically, you come now with non audiences, you create a one Facebook ad, and you send a Facebook ad to all audiences. And a Facebook ad says, By the way, next week, or two weeks time, we are having a huge launch of our new product on Amazon. And because because I was I was mistaken, we have a new product launching. And if you don&#8217;t get it a big discount, it&#8217;s just just click here and let us know. And then you live this way for two weeks. And this whole setup process can take maybe about an hour, we lived one for two weeks. And after two weeks, you come back to add and see which audience converted best. The best converting audience henceforth is your ideal avatar, that&#8217;s your customer. And then when you launch, you just reach out to all the customers that came through your flow. And so we&#8217;re alive now its launch it and maybe you brought in 300 people. So I recommend is don&#8217;t blast 300 people just send 10 people a message a day with 30 days. There you go. These people know because they&#8217;re aware of your marketing, they&#8217;re aware they&#8217;re going to be approached, and now you&#8217;re good. Marketing goes, your costs go down. And people don&#8217;t have to get a big discount. They don&#8217;t. And<\/p>\n<p>Michael Veazey 17:51<br \/>\nthis makes a lot of sense. Yeah, you because what you&#8217;ve done is super small. So just just analyze what you&#8217;ve done is, number one, you&#8217;ve tried different audiences, and you&#8217;ve honed in on it, but you&#8217;ve tried it, yes, it&#8217;s going to cost you some Facebook ads money, but it&#8217;s not costing you a bunch of rebates and Amazon costs, right. So there&#8217;s really smart. And the second thing related to that is, again, you&#8217;ve separated the process of finding the audience from the selling. But you&#8217;ve also separated the process of this is so smartly This is first I&#8217;ve heard of this from you, even though we speak quite a lot. But the second thing you&#8217;ve done is you separated, responsive people. So that&#8217;s an advertising type cost but not March. Well, actually, No, it isn&#8217;t even an absolute cost is it because you&#8217;ve got in touch with them. So you&#8217;ve separated the people who are likely to be responsive from the people who are unresponsive, says another reason why it&#8217;s going to cost you less, you have less, you have to push them over so much resistance. So therefore the discounts can be less. So the super smart. I mean, it makes a lot of sense, but splitting things into stages. So that the third thing is really smart about it is that you&#8217;re not just some guy going Hi, never heard of me get this discount now because everyone in the world does that. So and it&#8217;s going to get worse as this becomes more of a standard thing. So you&#8217;ve separated yourself out because it more respectful and you&#8217;ve got more rapport with the prospective client, which is always better. So really, really make sense. So I can see why the logic of it from a marketing perspective really makes sense. So tell me about the differences in results and cost if you compare that the sort of going straight in blunt cold approach versus their pre launch approach.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 19:22<br \/>\nSo I have one client now, actually, you actually know them but LNFY later, they&#8217;re a big big seller and they just launched some products. And now what they&#8217;ve done what they were getting credit for is that they know how to establish your brand nama Saint&#8217;s name for years, guys, you need to do some messenger marketing. This will work ridiculously well and that good. Okay, okay. But then I just helping them out and then a few things. Now why there was this right, I took all the people because they already have a brand because they already have a good Facebook page there you have a good website, everything why there was this with into this into the audiences on Facebook now created audiences of all the people already spoken to them. So people have spoken to the bots, audience of people who have been on their websites audience that have clicked on their Facebook ads, and so on, so forth. So we have like four or five audiences, and there&#8217;s a warm audiences,<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 20:17<br \/>\nthen what we did is that we ran a<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 20:19<br \/>\nsale thing 8% off, I say 8% off because we were at the launch. So it could be less, it actually should have been less because people didn&#8217;t believe was so good. And if people don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s so good, that you know, you&#8217;re charging too much. But anyway, so we did that, and that the costs were a fraction. So normally opinion perspective, if I do blank marketing to a cold audience, I can pay anywhere from a pound to two pounds per subscriber, very much. And a year ago, an expensive ad for me was maybe 50 P. Now dependent, the ads are increasing, no matter how good you get at Facebook ads, ads on increasing because the whole, the whole whole platform is increasing in costs. But anyway. So this campaign, normally I&#8217;ll expect to pay between one and two pounds, and we&#8217;ll paying anywhere from 20 to 40 p per subscriber. And that&#8217;s great, because they were really aware of our brand to shows a warm audiences chest so much cheaper. And now, it&#8217;s great because because of this brand, or they didn&#8217;t do any Facebook marketing, they did have an authoritative brand on Facebook and the web website, everything. So they set up everything and set a good foundation. They just acted on it. And now we did. And yeah, it&#8217;s working for them because it was so much so that they launched recently, really new products. And within with an average search volume of about two to 5000 a month. And all those products. We did, we did a few, a few sales. And we got up to I think we&#8217;re the top half of page one, and will be top of page one within the next week or so, purely because we could be more aggressive because we the ad costs were lower. I mean, I mean, in total, they spent maybe 300 pounds,<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 22:08<br \/>\nand they bought in terms of subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Veazey 22:10<br \/>\nThat&#8217;s quite a result. So 300 pounds overall, it just sounds like I was expecting numbers like in the thousands. But I mean, so yeah, getting to the top of page one. I mean, it&#8217;s all relative to lots of different factors, which will bore people with you need a spreadsheet, but yeah, 300 pounds, to get yourself to the top of page one, or as part of the mix is really pretty small in terms of absolute cash need. And but the also thing is that, yeah, as you said in the end, and the really smart marketers you read about like, some of them are to people&#8217;s taste in some not. But there&#8217;s Frank Kern, who if you get on his list will email you if you 2.5 seconds, but he&#8217;s relentlessly effective and has been for 20 years. And there&#8217;s Perry Marshall, who&#8217;s just I think super smart. And he&#8217;s an engineer with a sound acoustic engineering background that&#8217;s very much heavy. And they also the same kind of thing, which is if you get the economics of your marketing, right, you could you can buy a prospect prospect or even a customer cheaper than other people, you win. And that&#8217;s absolutely critical. So whether Facebook ads are going up in cost overall, which is obviously very important to bear in mind as one of the one channel versus another, but also it relative to the competition, all they&#8217;re doing is spending more and more and you&#8217;re smarter, and you spend less per prospective customer, then you win again, because you&#8217;re taking market share of them, which is different, you can&#8217;t control Facebook&#8217;s overall cost of advertising, but you can get market share and a market shares just for me, it&#8217;s a super critical driver of absolutely everything I people don&#8217;t respect that metric enough, I think if you get is the star principle, right, which of course, if you have a number one positioning by revenues, and you don&#8217;t bs about it, we&#8217;re the number one of x y Zed is the biggest claim made ever by everyone. But if you make twice as much revenue as the next person on the page, on Amazon, and in your products, what happens is that you can get higher volume, therefore you get better deals with your suppliers and therefore you have lower cost per unit. And you&#8217;re the preferred provider because visibility equals credibility that you can charge more. So you make double the amount of profit, as well as many more sales. This is an exponentially better business model. So and that&#8217;s really critical point to make.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 24:11<br \/>\nAnd also, one thing was the market share, I think it&#8217;s a very good point there because for example, now I&#8217;ve used example now baby blanket, that&#8217;s one product. But now my next part will be be like a baby pacifier. The next one will be your baby pillow. I don&#8217;t know where it is. But wherever it is, you will see is that I&#8217;ve done this the first time you launch a brand, it&#8217;s expensive. Because if you run Facebook ads, everything but after first launch, it gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper because the audience is very important. I don&#8217;t all I do is work with my audience, let&#8217;s say baby blankets, my baby blanket audience. What I&#8217;ll do is after often with our product, once a week, I&#8217;ll send them like a blog article saying top 10 tips to help your baby sleep better at night. I mean, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s not really clickbait. But that&#8217;s something mother&#8217;s appreciates to read. And then secondly, week I just send them pure content. I mean, we&#8217;re talking earlier before the webinar, or just before this podcast saying is that some marketers out there just doing pure content, and not even doing it in pictures. And it really does. Again, we do not have this marketing machine every week you send a broadcast message your scrubbers, they love you, you love them, and they make the pitch maybe once every every a while. And they wouldn&#8217;t mind because they like a bridge. Absolutely. And again, it&#8217;s sort of Facebook marketing and, and chatbot marketing growing up. I mean, really, that&#8217;s the same kind of thing that you do with email marketing, but it&#8217;s just a different platform.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Veazey 25:37<br \/>\nThe weird thing is that, I think you&#8217;ve just pointed out that in the end platform is powerful. And you&#8217;re a person who&#8217;s got software specifically built for a platform. But in the end, what Max is, is the marketing strategy, ie, number one makes your cost per acquisition of customers is less than your competition, because then you can win market share wise, all things being equal. And number two nurturing prospects and you know, we&#8217;ll find the right people. It&#8217;s the racket, the shotgun thing, again, it could get that paymaster talks about all the time, which is, you know, the The aim is not to try and sell to everybody. The thing is, as he says, right, the shotgun, you need to read the book at 20 sales marketing to find out what that&#8217;s about. But basically a few people respond, and then those who respond you market to and then you get the cheaper acquisition, and then you just nurture your prospects, which most people don&#8217;t do most people have an email list and do nothing with it. And then you slam the with the lead offers when he got sent to sell. And I&#8217;d be guilty of that in the past. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, what I do now, like, for example, with even with the podcast audience is just just send them updates. Like, for example, I&#8217;ll send them an update when this goes live and say, right, so some fantastic value from from Paul Harvey. So chatbot is not just value about chatbot was bigger value than that it&#8217;s a value about, you know, marketing in general, and Facebook ads in particular, and seeing where things are going as well. And that builds nice rapport with me and and get your name out there. And then of course, if we make a pitch at some point is based on a relationship rather than just turning up like a friend, he wants to turn up, and when when they need money and borrow some money off, and then you don&#8217;t see them again, for months, it&#8217;s never going to create a good relationship, right? So let&#8217;s talk about the actual specifics then of how you use a chatbot. So we talked about the Facebook marketing. And so talking about the chatbot side of it. So what are the sort of mechanics of a channel? a funnel that does this job? Pretty much<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 27:25<br \/>\nThink of it this way, right is that every amazon seller should have like a library of templates. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s the chapel it is because I mean, I love me chat I love was tech forums are really do just annoying, annoying, because every time I went into use a platform, or somebody will use a flow to create one even though the headaches are either set apart, or the template that you need for Amazon business is there already. So what I mean by that is maybe you wouldn&#8217;t do a review request as a flow asking for review, maybe you want to do a search and buy instructions as a flow for that. And maybe you can do it you would appears frequently bought together with your other competitors. As a flow for that. If you want to maybe some gamification, we create your own real and not just a little pictures, something then a few flows. But there&#8217;s actually you can create your real wheel of fortune and then add a bio shaman to that there&#8217;s tons of things you can do. And where I will recommend to everyone is a chatbot. Awesome, they really are. But don&#8217;t try and do everything. Start the beginning, just get the basics down. A lot of people say but all I want to do rebates and I want to automate the rebates. So PayPal gets automated, when they send the money through everything like know guys, like, go for automation, build everything, once you have the basics down. And once have basics done, you can do so many cool things. For example, what we teach is a very basic course, that&#8217;s great in the basic course. But here&#8217;s some absolutely ninja ninja strategies that can upgrade your current flows and compliment and further. But basically the only effective if you have the basics down. And again, I guess this me being a former teacher, we always say just the basics really is, again, a best teacher, if the kid doesn&#8217;t have the building blocks doesn&#8217;t understand that that&#8217;s a negative a negative is a positive. That will fail pretty much that whole syllabus because it&#8217;s the basics<\/p>\n<p>Paul Harvey 29:18<br \/>\nof building blocks, they can actually move forward.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Veazey 29:21<br \/>\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed that episode with Paul Harvey, of Seller chatbot. Paul, first of all, I hope you agree now having listened to him is not only expert, but humble. And that&#8217;s a lovely combination, because in the world of Amazon, but particularly people are saying software or tactics, and this is kind of both are the whole chatbot plus the tactics that surround it. It really invites the people who are want to sell you a course today for an overpriced number or some kind of software now. And then next year, they&#8217;ve disappeared, because it&#8217;s all against Terms of Service, or it isn&#8217;t going to last. And what I really like about Paul is that he&#8217;s honest about placing it in context. In other words, for example, chatbot, and how it compares with email, and give us a flavor of where the bigger context is going with it. The fact that Facebook pushing for it, he&#8217;s also prepared to talk about the limitations of it as well. So they say, and it&#8217;s a bit of a cheesy cliche, but I&#8217;m going to say it anyway. Because I think it&#8217;s important. I didn&#8217;t care how much you know, until I know how much you care. It&#8217;s a cheesy thing, but then we&#8217;re putting it is, if you&#8217;re technically competent, but not trustworthy, or not really got my best interest in heart, I don&#8217;t want to work with you, because it&#8217;s not going to serve me. So that&#8217;s the reason why I&#8217;m prepared and happy to be an affiliate of set a chatbot. And of Paul Harvey, I mentioned that because I&#8217;m about to suggest that you check out their stuff. If you go to amazing fba.com forward slash chatbot CHATBOT, amazing fba.com forward slash chatbot, then you can get some deals from going through that link. Because it&#8217;s an affiliate link, what would happen is that Paul would pay me some money for that lead, should it convert to a new customer, a new client, and you would not pay any extra. So no obligation on you to do any of that. But if you log in and buy chatbots, I certainly would recommend seller chatbot, whoever&#8217;s link you go through, because many chat and chat fuel, all the other ones are very, very good chatbot services, as I understand from Paul, but then not geared to the needs of Amazon sellers. And that&#8217;s the other thing, that if you&#8217;re going to work with somebody using a technical tool, you really don&#8217;t just want the tool, you want to know how to use it. I mean, somebody could hand me the world&#8217;s best handmade hammer, and wonderful gold plated nails. But if I&#8217;m haven&#8217;t been trained in carpentry, I&#8217;m not going to make good furniture. So it&#8217;s not the world&#8217;s greatest metaphor, but you get the idea. So one of the things that Paul offers as well as training and they have gotten advanced training is normally $499. So it&#8217;s not for people who are superficially interested in chatbots. But for those who are serious about it, it&#8217;s really going to pay dividends to understand about Facebook ads and chatbots and the optimum ways of setting them up. And if you want to do that the $499 training is, as I understand from Paul at the moment available for $299. So really worth checking out again, amazing fba.com forward slash chat bot, is the best way to go and get that to get the best deal that way as well. So I&#8217;m very happy to throw in bonuses on top of that as well. Either somebody who&#8217;s getting training from Paul and feel that I can add something to the party, email me with your receipt, or some other proof that you bought it or some screenshot. And I&#8217;m happy to have a chat about how how could sort of support you as a sort of bonus on top of that as well. So hope that is all good stuff. And whatever else you do, I think you&#8217;ve got to assess the fact that you&#8217;ve got to stay on top of the game with Amazon, things are always shifting. And for the note the moment chatbot is definitely one of the very powerful weapons in your armory. So at the very least you should check it out. Even if your conclusion at the end is no This doesn&#8217;t fit in with our marketing mix right now, rather than just turning your back on it at a prejudice. Because that&#8217;s always dangerous if the competition using a weapon and you don&#8217;t even want to assess whether it should belong in your armory. That&#8217;s when you start losing the battle.
