How can they get started?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The general advice is to start small. Most people would say to start with something that can be air-shipped and fits in a shoebox. Kevin believes that is the wrong approach because that&#8217;s what everyone else is doing. Instead you should go where others aren&#8217;t. The items may be a bit larger therefore you might have to ship them by sea to reduce costs, but there will be less competition which means more potential for success. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin has products in the kitchen category &#8211; he\u2019s actually doing things that go on the stove, weigh 3-4 lbs apiece. Can sell for $10-20 profit per sale rather than $4-5. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin is very emphatic about <a href=\"https:\/\/insight-quality.com\/how-to-manage-quality-control-for-amazon-fba\/\">ensuring the quality of the products<\/a>. Never, and he means never, ship products from China without an inspection. Whether it&#8217;s the first time working with the factory or the 6<\/span><span class=\"s2\">th<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. Always get an inspection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ensure that you take all these costs into consideration, and then make sure you can mark it up at least 3x. Preferably 5X Also, avoid any item that has been used as an example in a training course because there will be many people that will try to replicate it which in turn means more competition. Like Greg\u2019s bamboo sticks or Manuel Beaver\u2019s example product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, get good images. Pay to have high quality images of your items because it will make a difference and it will pay for itself through additional sales. Use all 9 images, at least 1500 pixels a side so they are zoomable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even if you spend $500 for great photos, and you sell one extra unit a day at $10 profit, you have your money back after a month and a half.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>A lot of people don&#8217;t read your copy. Kevin has put codes for 100% off in the description and only one person used it out of 50 orders. A vast majority of people will based their decision on the title, price, and picture. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A lot of this has to do with the fact that 60-70% of sales in the US are from mobile devices which limits how much copy people actually see. So you need to make the first little bit compelling. You have the first 200 characters of your description, and the first 3 bullet points (they have to click a button to see the others) . Make them count.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make sure you have good packaging. Your logo should be everywhere you can put it as well as instructions for the product that prompts the customer to register the product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Put an instruction sheet in with your packaging, that asks for a review on the back. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What advice can you offer about product launch?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sellics.com\/blog-how-to-launch-a-new-product-on-amazon\/\">Product launches<\/a> are very important. Don&#8217;t skimp on product quality. You may get away with it for awhile but eventually the returns and negative reviews are going to catch up to you. Make sure to test the product yourself to ensure a high quality. The more you know about, the easier it is to market. Especially if you develop a product yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As soon as there are 10-30 units of product ready (whatever fits in a case), he gets those sent over and then goes and looks for top reviewers &#8211; like Review Sniper, AMZSuite has something to look up top 10,000. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Or Google: Take competitor\u2019s ASIN,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Search string is something like:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">URL=<a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\"><span class=\"s3\">amazon.com<\/span><\/a><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>ASIN \u201ctop 500\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Reach out &#8211; let product speak for itself. Customise it to person &#8211; send out 15 emails to top 500 reviewers &#8211; Kevin gets say 11 out of 15 to respond. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t say \u201cIt\u2019s great\u201d; customise e.g. Milo is dog\u2019s name, so put in \u201cGreat new product for Milo\u201d in subject line. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Email:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> Hi Michael <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">We\u2019ve got a great new product that Milo might be interested in trying out.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Here\u2019s the link:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/B00ABCDEF\">www.amazon.com\/B00ABCDEF<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Let me know if you\u2019re interested in receiving one in exchange for your honest opinion. <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Thanks, Kevin<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t try and sell them on it. Let them click on the link &#8211; if they like it, they\u2019ll get back to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some of them get 200 emails a day. Some of it is garbage!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin doesn\u2019t chase them. Maybe 6-8 will write a review. He might do one follow up a week later. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Follow-up email: <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Hi Michael\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I hope the item arrived okay. Let me know if you have any questions. <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Looking forward to your comments. <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Thanks, Kevin<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t say things like \u201cI sent this to you for free &#8211; why haven\u2019t you reviewed it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The next step would be to invest heavily in pay-per-clicks for a few days. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He will bid say $5 a click for a few days on an Automatic campaign. Then dial back pay per click to say 50 cents a click. This will boost your visibility on Amazon. Any sales are just gravy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All you really need is 5-10 reviews. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It will boost the SEO value of your product which will lead to high conversion rates. You may be losing money on these sales but it will establish you in the search results. At this point you will want to incrementally increase the price back to where you intend to sell it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/marketingland.com\/stealing-competitors-customer-step-step-guide-140042\">Reach out to your competitors customers<\/a>. Look up top reviews of competing products and contact the top reviewers about your product with a personalized email. You can offer them the product for free for their opinion on it. This will help validate the product and get the ball rolling. The best would be to get a video review. Kevin recommends hiring a service that can connect your with reviews. He recommends getting two or three reviews per variation of your product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s critical to have a good video review, on the first page. If you get one down the road, it may get buried. If you get it early on, it\u2019s likely to stick to the first page. Kevin uses a service that has keen video reviewers. Even if it\u2019s a boring simple product, a 45 second video makes a big difference. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once he has several reviews,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>he\u2019ll discount the product say $45 product down to $19,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>and go for PPC aggressively. He\u2019ll start getting lots of sales for say 4-5 days, any reviews will be verified reviews. Low price boosts conversion rate. Losing money on each sale but cost of entry to market. Run for 200-300 units. It goes into algorithm.<br \/>\nThen raise to $24.95, $29.95 back up to $45 and that\u2019s where it will stay. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you go \u201cout of range\u201d (too high) with your price, you\u2019ll lose the buy box, even if you are the only seller! Amazon flags it as an error.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin looks at first shipment of say 1000 units as a cost of entry to a market. You have to buy your position. It\u2019s an upfront investment. He\u2019s got onto page 2, Kevin will spend a bit more to get to page 1, after which he will be into big profits. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can have a product that is not in a competitive category so you don\u2019t have to do much advertising. Just run a low bid ad campaigns. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin had a sports category<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>product that sold only 1-3 units a day, he played with various things till it took off. Now it sells about 20 a day at $14 profit per unit after advertising cost. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Kevin recommends \u201cHello Profit\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The importance of cost analysis (esp. advertising costs)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin explains that the number of sales doesn&#8217;t matter. Profit does. People who run Facebook groups who boast about sales numbers don\u2019t interest Kevin. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A lot of people have cashflow but they aren\u2019t making profit. You can have 100 sales a day, but if you don&#8217;t factor in advertising and other expenses into your cost, you might just break even or actually be losing money. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kevin uses spreadsheets to track his costs, once he has the data, he builds Advertising costs into Cost of Goods Sold. Kevin adds up what the overall cost of advertising is over all units sold. He knows therefore what his maximum spend on Amazon Ads can be to break even or to make a profit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t use ACoS to work out real ad costs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">EXAMPLE: Kevin has a custom product made in china for $20 each, $1.50 to ship, a few other fees, so hard cost is about $23. He sells it for $59. Amazon takes about a third roughly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SO Amazon is roughly paying him $40 cashflow. Now he knows how much PPC costs &#8211; he can spend $7 a unit sold on advertising to make $10 per product. If say his PPC sales are \u2153 of his sales, he could spend $21 per PPC sale and still break even.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t go off ACoS to work out true Ad cos per sale &#8211; you need to break it down. Export search term report into Excel or Google numbers etc. and create a pivot table. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brian Johnson (PPC expert) shows you how to do it in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hZjJhP77xdI\"><span class=\"s3\">this video<\/span><\/a>\u00a0\u2026and Greg Mercer (of <a href=\"http:\/\/affiliate.junglescout.com\/idevaffiliate.php?id=945_2\">Jungle Scout<\/a>) wrote a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.junglescout.com\/blog\/amazon-pay-per-click-optimization\/\"><span class=\"s3\">blog post<\/span><\/a> about it. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You need to factor in COGS and changes of sales price. Lifetime ACoS is almost meaningless. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">You need to see what you\u2019re making on every single sale: how much you made and how much you spent on Ads. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to do this analysis, hire someone else to do it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Kevin recommends <a href=\"https:\/\/helloprofit.com\/\"><span class=\"s3\">Hello Profit<\/span><\/a><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>It is a great tool that will factor in the advertising costs, manufacturing costs, refunds, fees, and everything else that affects your profit.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Kevin logs in 3-4 times a day and it will automatically calculate COGS, Amazon ads, Returns etc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s not perfect or as good as Xero or Quickbooks but it\u2019s the best thing to do to keep an eye on what\u2019s happening. Kevin uses it to adjust PPC. If you have more than one product, at least try their 21 Free or $1 trial. Don\u2019t forget to factor in Refunds!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is your process for keyword research?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do it before you order. Once Kevin decides on his product,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>he does the research. Before he places his first order. Using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.keywordinspector.com\/simple\/index.php\"><span class=\"s3\">Keyword Inspector<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificseller.com\/\"><span class=\"s3\">Scientific Seller<\/span><\/a>\u00a0, he will do research on his competitors to collect keyword data. <a href=\"https:\/\/adwords.google.co.uk\/KeywordPlanner\"><span class=\"s3\">Google Keyword planner<\/span><\/a> is good for research, as is<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merchantwords.com\/\"><span class=\"s3\">Merchant Words<\/span><\/a>, but some of the words are not associated with your product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Taking all the data gathered he uses<b> <\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.helium10.com\/\"><span class=\"s3\">Helium 10 <\/span><\/a>to makes sense of it all to find the best keywords. It de-dedupes it [removes duplicate keywords]. He\u2019ll use this tool to build out his listing. Kevin doesn\u2019t repeat keywords in his listing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Amazon is always changing so it&#8217;s important to stay up on the trends. Right now the title is very important. Everything in the title will get indexed by Amazon. If you have a title like \u201cBlue Garlic Press\u201d, it will also index you for \u201cGarlic Press\u201d &#8211; some are giving away 200 units to rank for 10 keywords. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The next thing to get indexed are the bullet points. Amazon tells you they don\u2019t index those but that\u2019s BS. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In most categories, they do not index The description <\/span><span class=\"s4\">doesn&#8217;t get indexed completely<\/span><span class=\"s1\">.
