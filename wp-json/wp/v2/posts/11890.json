However, as viable as e-commerce is, several factors risk its success, especially early. So, are you preparing to start an ecommerce business? Here are some mistakes you might want to avoid.\u00a0<b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>1. Choosing the wrong platform<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes you can ever make regarding your e-commerce business is choosing the wrong platform to launch from. There is a common misconception that the most popular platforms are automatically the best ones. The truth is, just because so many people are using a particular platform does not necessarily make it the right one for your business. When choosing a platform, there are some factors you need to consider. One of them is your understanding of how the platform works, its requirements, and how it can benefit your type of e-commerce business or online store. It would be best to consider things like user experience, ease of access, and usability.<\/p>\n<p><b>2. Not optimising page speed<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Research shows that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hobo-web.co.uk\/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds\/#:~:text=53%25%20of%20mobile%20site%20visits,rates%20of%20up%20to%2087%25\">53%<\/a> of online visitors or potential customers are likely to abandon a transaction if your page takes longer than 3 seconds to load. That is understandable, considering how fast most people want their transactions to go through. This is why you need to optimise page speed. The need for this is pretty simple: the slower your online store is, the less likely people will want to visit your page, and the more sales you will lose. There is a direct link between load time, online traffic, and conversions into sales &#8211; and no other way around it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DJ-XewdFr8A\">&#8220;How To Increase Your Website`s Page Speed ||19 To 98 On Google Page Speed Insights In 2 Minutes&#8221;<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/juliangoldie.com\/\">&#8220;Video by SEO link builder Julian Goldie&#8221;<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>3. Neglecting vital security measures<\/b><\/p>\n<p>One great thing about starting an ecommerce business is that you can do it from the comfort of your home before moving into an office. No matter where you start your business, you need to put the necessary security measures to protect your business from online and offline harmful threats. Regarding online security measures, always ensure that you use a reliable VPN (Virtual Private Network) to protect you from some levels of cyber threats, especially when working from home.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you move your business into an office space, you should also consider physical security measures like installing smoke alarms and having security locks on your doors and windows. Always ensure that you contact a reliable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.commlock.com.au\/\">commercial locksmith<\/a> with a trusted or proven record.<\/p>\n<p><b>4. Ignoring the analytics<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p>One other mistake you should avoid is ignoring the most powerful tools in the business. Different types of analytics will give you all the info you need about your business performance, the behaviour of your visitors, as well as the demographics you&#8217;re interested in. This way, you know what you&#8217;re doing right and what you need to improve.<\/p>\n<p>Your business\u2019s success story depends on the steps you take. Hopefully, you\u2019ll avoid these mistakes for the best results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There has never been an easier period to set up an ecommerce business than now.
