He\u2019s outsourced the part where he has to be there. He\u2019s travelling and running his business from his laptop (like Greg Mercer! &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/42\/\">see episode #42<\/a>)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">How did you do that?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Some wholesaling from US brands and Canadian brands and Private Label. If he can see a risk free dollar to invest for $1.20 in a couple of months, that\u2019s where he\u2019ll go. Basically he\u2019ll follow the cash!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you know where the cash is?<\/b><br \/>\nTwo paths<br \/>\n1. People do a bunch of research for 2 months, order a sample, test it, brand it, get logos made, finally get nice packaging, get 2000 units into amazon, give away a few hundred units. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">2 Will might call a US based brand, lots of products on Amazon, 100+ reviews but they\u2019re not Prime. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He\u2019ll call them, say, &#8220;Your account is not being well run,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>so most of your customers have to pay for shipping. We can run it better.&#8221;<br \/>\nHe\u2019ll order lots of product. He can see if that they sell $50k, he can buy $5000 worth and flip it in 10 days and make $2500 while the other person is still doing their research!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you just go after individual keyword opportunities or build a brand?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you see a wholesale company where say 10 of their 100 SKUs sell like crazy -Will often will Private Label one of those so as to offer the illusion of choice to the customer. But he will sell both the wholesale product and his Private Label product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">So it\u2019s going after a microniche?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you can take over all the listings on one page, it\u2019s very valuable.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Make all the listings individual rather than Parent-Child IF it is a low-competition keyword. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you just not bother with Parent-Child relationships?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">P-C makes a lot of sense if you&#8217;re after a competitive keyword because you\u2019re trying to drive all your sales to one listing. But if you have a low-competition keyword, it makes more sense to own the first page.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Does that take a lot of capital to invest?<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If Will sees that a brand sells $50k a month, the first order was still just $5K to return $7.5K. Then you reinvest for $11K and then keep doing that. <em>Turn the cash around as fast as possible<\/em>. Go after their hottest sellers and this is much easier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Example: One brand Will bought from recently had an\u00a0average selling price of $150 for its products.<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He ordered about 50 of their hottest selling products and sold those out within 5 days. <em>\u00a0<\/em><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><em>It\u2019s all about turning your cash as fast as possible<\/em>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">For those just starting on first product, how can you use this approach?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Fake it till you make it! Find products sold by a wholesaler that<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>are not being presented properly on Amazon. Make a free one week Shopify store, put in pictures of products and prices. \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/willsshovelstore.co\"><span class=\"s2\">willsshovelstore.co<\/span><\/a>m\u201d and an email. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Email them and say:\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019d love to sell your products. I\u2019m looking to Place an order for $5000 right now. \u201c\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">If it\u2019s a $5m company, \u00a0that&#8217;s\u00a0over 1% of revenue so you\u2019re a salesman\u2019s dream. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Then on to the next?<br \/>\n<\/b><br \/>\nYes! You cut so much BS out: creating the UPC, photos, listing creation etc. because they already exist! So you just<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0a<\/span>ccept products in, send them back out to Amazon and then move on to the next brand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If Will calls the brand and spends 2 hours on the phone and ends up making $40,000 profit in a year, that\u2019s $20,000 an hour income!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s not wasting his time building a brand. Getting cash in, not spending 2 months to make a logo. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Michael made a similar mistake starting out, which took 5 months to go live.\u00a0The\u00a0competition goes crazy, you don\u2019t know if it will sell out- it\u2019s all risk, little reward. Will takes little risks and gets rewarded multiple times: the aim is to make 20% return 6 times a year<em>[=around 300% annual ROI- Michael]<\/em> instead of trying to find one home-run product that will make you a million a year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s a lot easier to sell<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>1000 products once a day than 1 product 1000 times a day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Isn\u2019t the downside of that getting cash\u00a0tied up in inventory?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">So just order a week\u2019s worth of inventory. A lot of US brands will have just 3-10 day lead times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">So a really different model than everyone is teaching?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s hard to teach Amazon in general because everyone has different education, cash, cash flow, they have different responsibilities in life\u2026it\u2019s hard to write one course that suits everyone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Are you basically saying you would do wholesale first and Private Label afterwards?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>More times than not, it\u2019s super obvious. Say Will buys a product from a wholesaler for $40 and they want him\u00a0to sell it for $150. If there\u2019s that much margin, it must be bought from manufacturer for $10-15.\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">Will\u00a0goes Alibaba and confirms his suspicions. Then he\u2019ll source it and sell a Private Label version for half the price. A lot of the time, customers want the half price product as much as the named brand version. So you\u2019re selling it on price not brand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">For those just starting on first product, should they go for wholesale or Private Label (ie look on Alibaba etc.)?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.alibaba.com\">Alibaba<\/a> can be great, Will advises going after the lower-competition products. If you\u2019re making $10 profit and selling 10 a day, that\u2019s amazing, that\u2019s $36K a year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s so much easier to go after a lower competition product than after a product selling $50K a month. A lot of the time they are being sold by someone making a loss to keep the competition at bay.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Will likes to see one listing with 300-400 reviews (shows demand) and lots of listing under it with 20-40 reviews (competition is low). With giveaways Will can get that number very fast and get the 2nd Place spot. The 2nd listing down can sell as many as the 1st. The 1st may just have been there longer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What are the biggest problems you see with people launching their own Amazon business?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Just not getting started in the first Place! Analysis Paralysis on research. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Working on the business without making cash. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The other thing is cashflow. If they have $5K to invest, they order $5K of product, that means they don\u2019t have enough cash to order new inventory before running out of stock. If they have a 30 day lead time, and invested all their cash in inventory, selling too much too quickly can be a problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What\u2019s the solution?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The solution is to only put half of your investment cash into any order. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, Will and his brother ordered a container of knee scooters for $40K. That was 210 units. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">The lead time was 60 days from ordering to in stock at Amazon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> On the first day, they sold 7 units. If you do the maths, that means 210 units would sell out in 30 days (no. units\/units sold per day)<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>So they had to go back to the supplier that week and place another $40K order. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\">If you only had $40K in the first Place, you\u2019d have to wait until you\u2019d sold \u00be of your inventory before placing an order, which means you would be out of stock for 2 months. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">If you sell 20 units on the first day, do your multiplication!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">While generally taking out a loan to start an Amazon business is not good, when you have proven sales, and you need to get back in stock, this is a good time to get a loan from family or friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Will has been talking to private equity firms who want to lend to Amazon businesses because they love proven cash-producing products because they are tired of investing billions in startups with no turnover!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What are the other big mistakes do people make when launching their products?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Not thinking through:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">How will you get on page 1?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">How will you stand out? What will make the customer buy your product over someone else\u2019s?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Will will often do it via price but also it can be being differentiated.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What are others tips on differentiation?<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\nSize &#8211; if everyone is selling a 10\u201d pan, sell a 6&#8243; or 12\u201d each<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Colour &#8211; If everyone is selling a black product, sell a pink one. Even if the demand is lower. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Will sometimes\u00a0stands over his\u00a0mother\u2019s<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>shoulder to observe her buying style.<br \/>\nShe doesn\u2019t really care about 3 vs 5 bullet points,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>she doesn\u2019t know about all the reviews- she\u2019s not in an Amazon bubble! She takes about 2 seconds before hitting the one-click checkout button. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You need to stand out quickly via something visual &#8211; people aren\u2019t interested in reading text.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What other big mistakes do sellers make?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s about it. Either sellers<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>don\u2019t have enough cash or they try to sell a product they can\u2019t rank for. There are few other problems. Getting ripped off by a Chinese supplier is very very rare- but Will gets many emails saying \u201cI sourced this super competitive product and I have 5000 units, what should I do?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you recognise you\u2019ve got into an over-competitive product, there isn\u2019t much you can do. You could try giving out lots of units and spiking the sales rank but otherwise, sell them as a job lot on eBay!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You should have started smaller or tested demand some other way. So the mistake has already been made. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Be \u201cYoung Dumb and Stupid\u201d &#8211; a lot of smart people try to over-complicate Amazon &#8211; just sell a good product at a good price, then move on to the next one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The biggest things to differentiate yourself are product selection and good cashflow management.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Will listens to no\u00a0Amazon podcasts and instead reads general business books and applies general business principles to the Amazon model and it \u201cturns out pretty decent\u201d [$10m in sales!]<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>How can people contact you, Will?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Email: <a href=\"mailto:williamtjernlund@gmail.com\">williamtjernlund@gmail.com<\/a><br \/>\nTwitter:\u00a0@wtjern<br \/>\nWebsite: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amzhelp.com\/\">www.amzhelp.com<\/a><br \/>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tjernlund\">www.facebook.com\/tjernlund<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS PODCAST<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A podcast is a free downloadable audio show that enables you to learn while you\u2019re on the go.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>To subscribe to my podcast for free, you\u2019ll need an app to listen to the show from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For iPhone\/iPad\/iPod listeners \u2013 Grab your phone or device and go to the iTunes store and search \u201cAmazing FBA\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This will help you to download the free Podcasts App (produced by Apple) and then subscribe to the show from within that app.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Every time I produce a new episode, you\u2019ll get it downloaded right on yt sentence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For podcast enthusiasts \u2013 If you already listen to podcasts and have a podcatcher that you prefer, the feed you\u2019ll need to add is: http:\/\/ amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who don\u2019t have a mobile device \u2013 You can always listen to the show by clicking the audio file at the top of this page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have any queries, just go to www.amazingfba.com\/ask<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Master Seller Will Tjernlund &#8211;
