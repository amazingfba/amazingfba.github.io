This is a lot harder said than done! You\u2019re the boss, and you\u2019re at the helm, but what do you do next to ensure work goes smoothly and everyone\u2019s happy? You set up a workplace hierarchy, which can be incredibly useful to you in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, a workplace hierarchy can be the opposite of useful, and knowing when and where to cut the chain of command is essential. And with the help of the points below, we\u2019ll help you to work this out, as well as much more.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Clearly Define Responsibilities<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Every person on your team is going to have their own set of responsibilities, and unless you\u2019re looking to turn your office floor into a mosh pit, these need to be clearly defined and presented to each staff member. Of course, it should be in the initial job description, but those are often vague at best.<\/p>\n<p>Have a clear contract for your team members to sign, so they know exactly what\u2019s expected of them day by day. Assign roles as you see fit, but always take skill and experience into account first. And make sure you always stick to these same workplace rules, to try and avoid any type of schism.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Use Digital Systems to Your Advantage<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>You can also make good use of digital systems, to ensure your projects run smoothly and finish on time. A lot of project management software is out there, but at the same time, it\u2019s an idea to issue different levels of digital security to various members of your team. Some are managers themselves, others are junior staff, and then there\u2019s you at the top &#8211; it\u2019s an easy way to set out your hierarchy without needing to delay or explain.<\/p>\n<p>Each one of these people on your team has their own portal to log into, their own <a href=\"https:\/\/proofid.com\/services\/iam-managed-service\/\">identity management<\/a> key to use, and their own work to get on with. It\u2019s a cycle of productivity, with every single person knowing exactly what they\u2019re meant to be doing, with their own workload neatly presented to them, and a chain of command overseeing them.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Dial Back on a Toxic Hierarchy<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>As we mentioned above, sometimes a workplace hierarchy can devolve into something a lot more toxic, and it\u2019s important to stop such a change in its tracks. Maybe one of your junior staff is always expected to make drinks for everyone else in the break room &#8211; this isn\u2019t fair, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/erikaandersen\/2014\/02\/10\/four-ways-to-make-hierarchy-less-awful\/#397030623b05\">highly unprofessional<\/a>, and needs to be stamped out as soon as possible! Be sure to always check in with how your staff are doing, what they\u2019re thinking, and offer anonymous feedback to ensure you\u2019re always getting an honest response.<\/p>\n<p>A workplace hierarchy can be good and useful, so set yours up right, and always be on the lookout for some bad behaviour in your workplace.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So you\u2019ve landed that big job, you\u2019ve collected a team of skilled, intuitive workers, and now you\u2019ve got to set the chain of command.
