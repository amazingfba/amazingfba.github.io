And with more people than ever bringing their businesses into the online world, it&#8217;s getting harder than ever to get traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily for you, by using the right eCommerce SEO strategies, you can quickly increase your traffic with life-changing results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s explain a little further:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Does Your Online Store Need SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put it very bluntly, if you don&#8217;t incorporate SEO into your business plan, there&#8217;s a good chance your store will be out of business within 24 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And no, this isn&#8217;t being dramatic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see, your success relies on one thing, and it&#8217;s not by having the best products; it&#8217;s about your ability to drive customers to your website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might seem strange at first; surely having the best products would equate to more sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in a way, it&#8217;s right, but if you don&#8217;t have the traffic coming to your website, you&#8217;re going to struggle big time!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how do you use eCommerce SEO to help boost your rankings and, in turn, increase your traffic?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 4 Necessary Stages To A Robust eCommerce SEO Strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When people think of SEO, they think it&#8217;s going to be super technical, when in fact, it really isn&#8217;t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a quick task, you still need to put a lot of work in, but it&#8217;s not complicated stuff. Keep reading if you want to find out more about eCommerce SEO:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Site Audits\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you start any SEO campaign, the first you need to do is check the foundations of your website, and to do this; you need to run a site audit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because broken foundations on your website can kill all the effort you put into your SEO, which is not something you want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;re probably thinking, &#8220;What issues does a site audit fix?&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common problems found on a site audit are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next to no content\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duplicate Content<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">404 pages<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Site hard to crawl<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It used to be pretty challenging completing a site audit, luckily times have changed since then.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you have several SEO tools you can use to complete an onsite audit:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ahrefs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEMrush<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Screaming Frog<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any of these tools can do a fantastic job at auditing your site, but there are a few things you should know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ahrefs and SEMrush cost a bit of money if you want to use them, but they give you all the tips you need to fix the problems they find.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Screaming Frog, on the other hand, is completely free to use for the first 500 pages, but you need a little more knowledge to complete the audit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword Research<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keywords are one of the main ranking factors used by search engines, so it is something you really need to pay attention to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/what-sets-the-best-e-commerce-businesses-apart-from-the-rest\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eCommerce store&#8217;s success<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> relies on your ability to pick the right keywords for the product you&#8217;re selling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And to pick the perfect keyword, you need to think about four things:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Search Volume &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Most people will pick their keyword based on the traffic it brings, and it&#8217;s an important thing to think about, but it&#8217;s not the only thing you need to think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try and gauge what regards as high traffic for your niche; it can vary between niches, so what&#8217;s high for one might not be for another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Relevance &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is a very important factor for reducing your website&#8217;s bounce rate and increasing conversions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&#8217;s the thing:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If someone clicks on a keyword about sports shoes, but they find shorts, they are going to feel pretty annoyed and click away from your store.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that&#8217;s why you need to think so hard about the relevance of your keyword.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Competition &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> People often forget to think about the competition a keyword has, or it&#8217;s not even something they knew needed to be a consideration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To have a chance of ranking for a keyword, you need to make sure your Domain Rating (DR) can compete with the other sites we currently rank for that keyword.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Intent &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is a super important factor to think about if you want to increase your conversions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see, the right keyword can attract people who are at the right stages of the sales funnel, which is just what you need to increase conversion and revenue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you keep these four things in mind when you pick your keyword, you&#8217;ll be setting yourself up for success.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On-Page Optimization<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On-page optimization is all about making your website more crawlable for Google and more user friendly for your visitors. You may have heard about on-page SEO if you&#8217;ve experience with working on websites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, eCommerce SEO works a little bit differently, so pay attention:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Optimize Your Meta Description &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Your meta description should give an honest account of what your page is about, but it also needs to draw people into the page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another top tip is to sprinkle some extra keywords to give yourself a little boost in the rankings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Change Image File Names &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When people are searching for specific products, they usually use Google image search.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changing the file names to the name of the product or including the keyword will go a long way for ranking your images. And of course, optimize your alt tags along with the same accord.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Use High-Quality Pictures &#8211;<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> One of the biggest downsides of shopping online is not being able to touch and feel the product before buying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this reason, it&#8217;s highly important you start using high-quality pictures of all your products. If you&#8217;re not a great photographer your best option is to hire one to take the pictures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to make all of this much easier to do, and more likely to succeed, you might want to consider finding and using a professional team. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalsearchmarketing.co.uk\/seo-agency-worcester\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best SEO agency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be able to optimize your site much better than you might imagine, and it could make all the difference in the world to how your online business succeeds in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Internal Links For The Win &#8211; <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal linking is one of the most underutilized SEO strategies in eCommerce stores.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people struggle to find places for their links, but there&#8217;s an intelligent way to do it, just look at how Amazon adds there internal links:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are just a few on-page SEO factors you need to examine to succeed.
