After all, paying competitive salaries to your staff is hardly all you need to spend to keep people around. You need insurance, training measures, daily resources, functional utilities, and equipment. All of that, of course, tends to pay for itself given the hard work of your staff member often generating more wealth than they demand of you to be functional. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you can always justify that cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if your circumstances have become rather tight as of late, are there still methods you can take for avoiding layoffs? We believe there are. In this post, we\u2019ll discuss what they could be, and how to go about them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Responsible Cost-Cutting<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way of avoiding layoffs is to trim the far. There&#8217;s usually some fat to trim in most <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/buying-a-business-step-1-decide\/\">businesses<\/a>. It could be as simple as those fancy office snacks or the top-shelf coffee you\u2019ve provided thus far, or perhaps it&#8217;s time to look at those subscriptions that nobody really uses such as e-learning modules that could be one training session. It&#8217;s worth going through expenses with a fine-tooth comb &#8211; for example, the next time you expand your storage you could buy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.absolutestorage.com.au\/used-racking\/\">used pallet racking<\/a> to save costs on a macro level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Streamlining Departments<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, limiting layoffs means trying to make staff <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartsheet.com\/streamlining-processes\">more productive<\/a>. If people can do more than one job, it makes the whole team more flexible, and flexibility is good when things are uncertain or when you need to drive your growth. It might mean shuffling some responsibilities around or bringing disparate people into one department, but that&#8217;s better than losing good people..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Layoff Only Part-Time or Outsourced Roles<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If cuts really do have to happen, looking at part-time or outsourced roles first might be a way to go. It&#8217;s not that these roles aren&#8217;t important or that the people involved haven\u2019t done a great job, but they might be easier to adjust without disrupting the core team, whose loss of knowledge and experience could cause real disruption to your team. Maybe some of those tasks could be spread among full-time staff, at least for a while as you restructure and develop for the future. It\u2019s not easy, but it helps you in avoiding layoffs in the core team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limit Training Or Other Investments Temporarily<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luxuries can be put on pause while you go through a tough period. For example, if you throw a massive staff awards show each year, you could cut that out and just deliver the credit you had planned without the big event. You might not have a Christmas party this year. Or, you might not review certain training with staff outside of adopting a new software standard, cybersecurity and essential safety training. Perhaps team building can be cut too. These little investments can add up to avoiding layoffs and may help you save a job role, which could be infinitely more valuable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this advice, we hope you can better make the tough but necessary calculations to avoid layoffs. Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Layoffs are never fun, but sometimes avoiding layoffs seems impossible.
