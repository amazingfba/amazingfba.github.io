Certain marketplaces will be better suited for certain products. For example, if you wanted to sell barbecue equipment in the UK right now, while it\u2019s in the middle of January and it\u2019s freezing cold, you won\u2019t do well. You might get a few hardened people (like me!) that walk around in shirts while it is 5\u00b0 C, but not many. Certain products aren\u2019t going to work out in certain marketplaces at certain times.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tune Your Listing to the Amazon Marketplace<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be that you sell a product in one marketplace and it does really well, then you try to sell it in another and it does poorly. You have to make sure to do the right things. You have to dial in your pay-per-click and your keyword research needs to be specific to each marketplace. Don\u2019t be lazy and transfer over what you already have because it can work quite differently. Especially if you\u2019re a UK seller trying to sell in the US marketplace or vice-versa. Don\u2019t assume the keywords are the same, they often aren\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say, even once you\u2019ve done that, and done your pay-per-click properly, and did a proper launch, your product isn\u2019t taking off. I wouldn\u2019t say to kill it, but maybe pause that listing and let your inventory sell off. This isn\u2019t a product you\u2019d want to re-order.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Know When to Walk Away<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classic example, I had a generic product in the US marketplace, we\u2019ll call it a <strong>blue \u00a0widget<\/strong>, sold great, but only at a certain price point which wasn\u2019t profitable. If I raised the price, it would drop to page five and sales would disappear. Now a niched-down version of that product, call it a<strong> stainless steel blue widget<\/strong> , did much better. I sold 1200 units in six weeks at a 25-30% margin. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With those same products in the UK, it was a different story. The generic\u00a0<strong>blue \u00a0widget<\/strong>\u00a0version did a few sales a day at a profit. However, the niched-down version, the one that sold 1200 units in a few weeks in the USA, was very disappointing. It, maybe, sold one or two units a day, even though it was still on page one, albeit at the bottom. For me, that\u2019s not worth the time and effort to keep doing that. I was then able to reallocate my money and focus into something else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This isn\u2019t so much giving up an Amazon marketplace as such, but rather, giving up a certain product in a certain\u00a0marketplace. I encourage you to look at your numbers. Make decisions based on the data rather than what you wish was the situation. Just because you invested a lot of time, money, and effort into something, doesn\u2019t mean you have to stick to it. You have to be willing to walk away if the data shows that it\u2019s not working. It&#8217;s called a sunk cost and it&#8217;s an incredibly important discipline for all business people.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Need more personalised input on issues like this?
