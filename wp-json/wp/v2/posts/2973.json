So Systems, Culture, Impact helps Amazon businesses to scale up and helps them fully install systems into their businesses and create a great virtual team with a great team culture.<\/p>\n<h2>Aaron\u2019s Background<\/h2>\n<p>Aaron started on Amazon in 2013. At first, it was a side gig while he was working in the mining industry in the far north of Australia. He dabbled in affiliate marketing before finding ASM1 and getting into the Amazon world. After attending the ASM event, Aaron went all in on Amazon. After 5 months he was able to quit his job and focus on his business full time. Meanwhile, his business partner was building a team of staff in the Philippines and asked Aaron to join. They ended up having a team of 45 staff running multiple different brands across all different types of industries and niches on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>It was a challenge to come up with the systems to be able to scale those different brands. That\u2019s how Aaron learn what worked and what didn\u2019t work and how to start a business online. He learned it pretty quickly, created a process and system for how to remove yourself as much out of business as possible and attracting great virtual assistants in the Philippines.<\/p>\n<h2>How To Start a Business Online: Systematizing<\/h2>\n<p>At the beginning of your Amazon business, overwhelm can strike quickly. Aaron suggests starting with the end in mind. Everybody\u2019s situation will be different. It\u2019s important to have an idea of how many products you want to launch, by when, and have a rough idea of when you want to get your first employee. He says it is much better to plan that from the beginning than to go about it without any foresight.<\/p>\n<p>Hiring without a plan often means you don\u2019t have any processes and you may not know what areas of the business you will bring them on that are the highest value to enable you to grow faster. Start thinking about your business outcomes and creating structure from the start. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t hit the targets you set for yourself. It\u2019s something to work towards.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got clarity on your big vision, you break it down into outcomes for the quarter. Then once a week\u2014for Aaron it\u2019s Sunday\u2014spend some time looking at this quarter\u2019s outcome and plan out the week ahead. From that week\u2019s plan, you put the most important things you\u2019re your calendar or project management tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/asana.com\/\">Asana<\/a>. That weekly rhythm helps prevent overwhelm, keeps you moving forward and starts to really build traction.<\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_149\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=149\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h2>The Hype Versus Reality<\/h2>\n<p>If you have done a course to get started on Amazon, don\u2019t just rely on the course to give you structure. Most courses are there to help you launch one product, which is great. But you need to think beyond that from the start. If you come from a big course, they might have sold it to you on this big vision, which is very optimistic.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/mentoring\/mentoring-faqs\/\">Give me a call<\/a> to help you check it to make sure that you\u2019re setting up a plan based on reality not based on hype.<\/p>\n<p>Take the things you\u2019ve learned and distill them into a really simple system for you to use yourself, and block it into your calendar. Connecting with your vision and plan in your document each week helps keep you motivated and on track.<\/p>\n<h2>Reflecting on Progress and Celebrating the Wins<\/h2>\n<p>It can be challenging if you do find there is a big mismatch between the original outcomes and the reality of what has happened. It\u2019s less likely to be a shock to you, though, if you have a weekly check in routine as Aaron suggests. Just like a pilot is continually adjusting the airplane\u2019s path throughout the flight, checking in weekly allows you to reflect on what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not and whether you\u2019re on track towards your outcomes or if you need to make adjustments.<\/p>\n<p>Many people business owners and entrepreneurs are born optimists, but reality doesn\u2019t always go as planned and we feel like a failure. It\u2019s not failure it\u2019s just learning. Remember that as long as you\u2019re moving forward, that\u2019s a win. Many high achievers have high expectations of themselves and can be very harsh on themselves, but focus on all the progress you\u2019ve made too. Make a point of celebrating the wins and acknowledging how far you have come.<\/p>\n<h2>What to Outsource First<\/h2>\n<p>Aaron generally recommends outsourcing the things in your Amazon business that occur with high frequency and that are low-value activities. Often, these are repetitive tasks that happen each week like customer service, commenting on reviews and Amazon PPC. Once the system is set up, they\u2019re repetitive weekly tasks that can easily be outsourced.<\/p>\n<p>The process Aaron takes his clients through is taking stock of where they spend their time. Which areas they spent the most time. Which areas they like and dislike the most and things that you aren\u2019t very good at. He calls the process \u201cmoving into your genius\u201d because of the four categories he divides activities into incompetence, competence, excellence, and genius. Track your time for 5 \u2013 7 days, then label your tasks with one of those categories and figure out the ones that are the low value, high-frequency activities so you can get some clarity on what to start getting rid of first.<\/p>\n<p>However, remember it\u2019s not always about delegating stuff that\u2019s cheap and nasty. Take photography for example. You may delegate that to a professional photographer who will earn more per hour but it\u2019s such an important area for an Amazon seller that it would still be worth it.<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned for part 2 of this interview where Michael and Aaron dive into outsourcing in more depth.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=149\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3>People and resources mentioned in this episode:<\/h3>\n<p>ASM1<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/asana.com\/\">Asana<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tonyrobbins.com\/pdfs\/Workbook-Time-of-your-Life.pdf\">Tony Robins<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/toddherman.me\/\">Todd Herman<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/One-Thing-surprisingly-extraordinary-results-ebook\/dp\/B00D3J2QKW\/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502243742&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=The+One+Thing+by+Gary+Keller\"><em>The One Thing<\/em> by Gary Keller<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity\/dp\/0142000280\">Getting Things Done by David Allen<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone\/dp\/0241958229\/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502243957&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=Start+with+Why+by+Simon+Sinek\"><em>Start With Why<\/em> by Simon Sinek<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch How to Start a Business Online<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221;
