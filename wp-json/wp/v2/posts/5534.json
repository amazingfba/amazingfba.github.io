For good reason. It <em>is\u00a0<\/em>possible to grow a profitable business fast. However, there are a number of myths about business building on the Amazon platform that often get circulated by over-optimistic course promoters. Here we examine the truths behind the myths.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Business Building Myth 1. &#8220;One size fits all&#8221;<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Most courses gave a one-size-fits-all course. Simplifying is understandable and necessary. But they didn\u2019t allow for differing levels of risk aversion and experience in incoming students. Or allow for developing the necessary skills.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/PLP\">our PLP course<\/a> allows for this by offering different starting points depending on the level of skill, money and risk-tolerance of students.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Business Building Myth 2: &#8220;Our business model is like a franchise&#8221;<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">If you buy a franchise with Starbucks,\u00a0 you get exclusive rights to the territory! Plus you get the\u00a0 marketing backup and the right to use logos and other brand marketing that is supported by major brand recognition, in turn supported by brand advertising.<\/p>\n<p>No Amazon course on building a business can really offer you that, even though a couple seem to.\u00a0 However, what you <em>can\u00a0<\/em>get is proven business systems aka\u00a0\u00a0SOPs. Those <em>are\u00a0<\/em>definitely worth having &#8211; but just be realistic that you&#8217;ll need to bring your own individual spin to the party.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Business Building Myth 3: &#8220;You can just construct your own business model from free content.&#8221;\u00a0 (<\/b><b>YouTube,\u00a0 podcasts, FaceBook groups, etc.)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Of course there are a ton of Amazon tactics out in the Youtube world. Some mechanics like opening an Amazon seller central account, are well served by that.\u00a0 What you <em>won\u2019t<\/em> get\u00a0 is the order and sequence that is critical to real business building. Or strategic thinking.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Of course you can still build a business from scratch. But it\u2019s usually easier and quicker to model what works, then add your own spin. Reinventing the wheel costs time when building a business and opportunity cost is the highest cost. If you are months slower than you need, and miss out on $10s of thousands of lost sales, what does it matter that you saved yourself a few hundred pounds or dollars by not buying training?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">That\u2019s why most intelligent entrepreneurs start by modelling an Amazon business building process that works and then tweaking and personalising that.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Business Building Myth 4. &#8220;This requires no experience or skill&#8221;.\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>This is both true and untrue.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, there is no substitute for experience or skill. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, you can hire <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.securelogic.com.au\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IT support services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get you up and running or model your business on the competition\u2019s to get things off the ground, but that will only get you so far before you need some experience of your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, if you said \u201cno previous experience or pre-existing skill\u201d required, we\u2019re starting to get there.<\/p>\n<p>A good course will make sure you acquire that skill and experience.<\/p>\n<p>This is why we\u2019ve developed the system in the PLP course to make sure our entrepreneurs gain experience one step at a time. [the PLP course is currently unavailable while we update it &#8211; we will be making a modernised version avaliable soon]<\/p>\n<p>Which brings me to another key hole in this approach\u2026<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Business Building Myth 5: &#8220;You must abandon your background knowledge\/experience &#8220;<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">If have inside knowledge &#8211; even if just as an avid user of certain categories of products &#8211; then that can help you get an edge. As Ash Ali says<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/theunfairadvantage.co.uk\"><span class=\"s1\">https:\/\/theunfairadvantage.co.uk<\/span><\/a> <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>you should <i>always <\/i>be looking for an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d.
