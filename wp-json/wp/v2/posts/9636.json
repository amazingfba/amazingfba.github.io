And how to organize?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>From his data &#8211; the number of keywords amazon shows for a given product, probably 150-200 keywords. Amazon won\u2019t care about the camp structure.<\/p>\n<p>Some might be 500; some 10!<\/p>\n<p>150 keywords typically get impressions.<\/p>\n<p>75-100 keywords typically get clicks.<\/p>\n<p>30-50 keywords typically get conversions.<\/p>\n<p><em>Campaign structure doesn\u2019t affect this!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Amazon wants relevance!

You might find 20 smaller keywords are more important.<\/p>\n<p>Set a foundation then aim to let them grow organically at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>The ultimate outcome is to go for the ultra competition<\/p>\n<p><b>How do you choose what mid and long term keywords to target?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Brand analytics will give you click-through and conversion rates.<\/p>\n<p>Top 3<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Highly searched terms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What are the top ranking competitors for a keyword I already convert on?<\/p>\n<p>I might have a conversion rate of 10%<\/p>\n<p>Use Brand analytics &#8211; top 3 competitors are 20%, 10%, 5% conversion rate<\/p>\n<p>It will be hard to overtake the top 2 based on conversion rate &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>If your conversion rates aren\u2019t in line with the top of page one. You won\u2019t \u201cstick the landing\u201d if you use a launch service.<\/p>\n<p>There is more speculation and estimation about the bottom of page one as they are not included in Brand Analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Is the keyword too generic for you to take on now?<\/p>\n<p>Eg: Ballpoint pen &#8211; maybe \u201cmedium tip ballpoint pen\u201d<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower competition<\/li>\n<li>Higher conversion rates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><b>How does the ranking on page 1 or 2 work?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Page 2 is more frequent than page 10!<\/p>\n<p>If people buy grey medium tip ballpoint pen after looking for \u201cballpoint pen\u201d, you\u2019re more likely to get organic sales.<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of organic sales on page 1.<\/p>\n<p>Some sellers may not be tracking longer-tail keywords<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They track sales\u00a0 from top 5 keywords<\/li>\n<li>But often don\u2019t track 20 keywords\u00a0 page 2<\/li>\n<li>50 keywords\u00a0 page 3<\/li>\n<li>200 keywords\u00a0 page 4<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can use brute force to rank a product for a keyword.<\/p>\n<p>But if you don\u2019t have a conversion rate, it will slide.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon will rank you for a more competitive keyword by ranking for mid-ranking keywords.<\/p>\n<p>So the key is usually to build a base of multiple longer- and medium-tail keywords to rank for shorter-tail, more competitive keywords.<\/p>\n<h4><b>What long-tail keywords should I target?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The issue is shopper behaviour.<\/p>\n<p>If they start off with \u201cballpoint pen\u201d, they don\u2019t know what they want.<\/p>\n<p>Then they look at results and mentally refine.<\/p>\n<p>They start clicking through and find what they\u2019re visually looking for.<\/p>\n<p>That is what happens with \u201cnatural\u201d \u201corganic\u201d \u201crecycled\u201d &#8211; that\u2019s what drives the conversion.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, you need to be able to run ads and have content (Images or titles etc. ) directly relevant to the keywords.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s going to be hard to find a specific audience.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t get away with not having a generic term.
