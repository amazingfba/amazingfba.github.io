Nobody succeeds 100 percent of the time. Even the greatest of the great are familiar with failure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are some mistakes that are more avoidable and predictable than others. In this post, we run through the most common errors made by newbie founders and how to avoid them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Ignoring Cash Flow<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow is the most important financial indicator for your firm. It tells you whether your enterprise can afford to make payments to suppliers and employees to keep it in business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, some founders don\u2019t keep track of their cash flow. So, one morning, they wake up and see that they have no money in their account to continue paying for the running of their business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of profitability here isn\u2019t always the issue. Usually, companies have a lot of money in their accounts receivable. It\u2019s just that they haven\u2019t got it yet, forcing a cash crunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Failing To Take Exchange Rate Volatility Into Account<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exchange rate volatility can wreak havoc with your profit margins. Even small fluctuations in the relative price of a currency can lead you to begin making losses overseas.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trick here is to learn how the currency markets work. Whenever you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fpmarkets.com\/it\/forex-trading\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trade forex<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you are purchasing currency at its current market value. However, you can fix prices in place with your suppliers via contract ahead of time to reduce the risk of wild changes in relative prices. This helps to smooth over volatility and helps all parties &#8211; buyers and sellers &#8211; gain more predictable income streams.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Offering Too Many Products Too Soon<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, companies should try to make themselves known for one or two things. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.feedough.com\/brand-dilution-definition-causes-examples\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excessive dilution of brand<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and products can confuse customers, particularly if your company is new. Don\u2019t try to please everyone. Just focus on a specific group of customers you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">know<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you can serve.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Failing To Engage The Community<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New companies sometimes imagine that people will seek them out automatically. But, again, there\u2019s no guarantee that will happen. That\u2019s why things like freebies and contests are so important. Events like these naturally attract people to your brand and can be a great way to introduce them to what you do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Trying To Do It All By Yourself<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying to build a business all by yourself is a tremendous challenge. It also goes against the purpose of creating a company in the first place. If you insist on doing everything yourself, you don\u2019t take advantage of the unique skills and talent in your organization. Your enterprise becomes <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/effective-strategies-to-supercharge-business-efficiency\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inefficient<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where possible, delegate. Give other people responsibility and autonomy. Just focus on the things that you can control, such as your hiring decisions. Don\u2019t get involved in the minutiae of management. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/psychcentral.com\/blog\/6-ways-to-become-more-independent-less-codependent\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let others grow and develop independently<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so that they become more competent in their roles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Failing To Understand What Customers Want<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, some newbie business founders fail to understand what their customers want.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by building a customer profile. Then carefully monitor customers to discover what it is that they really love about your business. What itch are you scratching for them?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mistakes are a part of life. Nobody succeeds 100 percent of the time.
