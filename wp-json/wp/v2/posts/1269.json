But is it still a viable business model, to approach a wholesaler and try to sell on Seller Central?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thesellingfamily.com\/wholesale-101-the-ultimate-guide-for-buying-wholesale-and-reselling-on-amazon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buying wholesale for Amazon<\/a> from a \u00a0brand owner is still viable for sure; someone which owns one brand. As far as a wholesaler, that distributes several brands, it depends. They have to make their profit too, and there might not be enough margin to go around. They are also likely to be selling to other Amazon sellers which would cut into your sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you go to Back Country, they would carry the Black Diamond brand, as well as many others. Will wouldn\u2019t buy from them but rather buy directly from Black Diamond.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to get a product launched on Amazon these days?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the big reasons Will got into <a href=\"https:\/\/vendorcentral.amazon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vendor Central<\/a> is that he hates launching products. It\u2019s much easier to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/blog\/amazon-selling-tips\/#get-more-reviews-and-then-more-after-that\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">start with a product that already has 10,000 reviews<\/a>. His philosophy is not to do something that\u2019s hard just because it\u2019s hard. So many people are worried about building a brand and launching products from scratch. It\u2019s a lot easy to just make money first. Then, when you want a challenge, build your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One recent product launch Will and his team did, was they got ping pong accessories from China. Got them in, slapped labels on them, no real packaging to them. They sent them into Amazon. There was four different types that they bundled in two and four packs. They\u2019ve sold about 357 units in a month in a half and they just got their first review.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They spent $1000 on PPC \u00a0to make $4000 so their A-cost is about 25% which is about break-even but gets them some traffic. It\u2019s selling about seven units a day at $6 or $7 and he did nothing more than throw it up on Amazon. It\u2019s all because he picked the right niche with the right keywords. He knew he could compete only on price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are trying to go after a product that has 1500 reviews, then you will need 1500 reviews just to compete. What\u2019s your strategy for getting 1500 reviews? If you do 1500 giveaways, that\u2019s not sustainable. If someone wants to sell dog leashes because they love dogs, what can you do with that? You can\u2019t put your love of dogs in the title. You can\u2019t work with that. However, if you want to sell leashes because you see a gap in the market of seeing-eye dog leashes. They\u2019re all 20ft long which makes no sense if the person is blind. It needs to be 4ft long. Great! You found a gap in the market. You found a specific keyword. There is a way to differentiate yourself and add value. Also, you didn\u2019t need to do some crazy manufacturing. Just make a shorter leash.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking off-Amazon, do you see any future with Walmart\u2019s third party seller platform?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. No one really has that app on their phone. A lot of people will go out of their way to avoid shopping at Walmart. Just Google \u201cpeople of Walmart\u201d. There is a negative stigma. Much like eBay. Will they take a portion of the market? Yeah, but they won\u2019t be a major competitor. People like the simple Amazon experience. Plus, if you\u2019re going to buy something from walmart.com, why not just drive down the road and get it right now? The only real benefit Will sees from walmart.com is that if your product does well on their website, they might try to sell it in the stores and then you\u2019ll be able to sell it in all the big-box stores.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of eBay, do you think their market share will shrink in the next couple years?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will was recently talking with a hedge-fund manager that owns a part of eBay who said that eBay looks good compared to other retailers. Who are the competitors? Macy\u2019s who\u2019s closing thousands of stores. Sears who is closing thousands of stores. Of course their going to look good in comparison when the competition is about to go bankrupt. They may grow 3.5% year after year, but the S&amp;P average was 18%. 3% isn\u2019t that cool. The numbers of people that get online in America grows at 3%. So eBay is growing at the rate of the internet and slower than GDP.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re wanting to get started in Vendor Express quickly, what would you look for in a product?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will want to find a product in a category that Amazon isn\u2019t sourcing and selling already. Then they will want to get their hands on it. Plus, if you have sales history on top of that, Amazon will love it. If you find that Amazon isn\u2019t selling in climbing ropes, but they are selling 9 of the 10 dog leashes, then they\u2019re not too excited to get anymore dog leases. Buying wholesale is a good way to start this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the <a href=\"https:\/\/content26.com\/blog\/amazon-vendor-central-v-seller-central\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Difference between Amazon FBA Selling VS. Vendor Central<\/a>?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It really depends on a lot of factors. It depends on how much cash flow you have, what kind of distributor you have, what the competition is like. Let\u2019s say you have one Chinese supplier that you buy iPhone cases from. They\u2019re the only ones that are waterproof and you buy 10,000 at a time and you have $100,000 in the bank. From they, maybe you build momentum in Seller Central, then move it to Vendor Central so they see the momentum. In Seller Central, you might be ranked in the thousands for iPhone cases, but in Vendor Central you might be rank 1 for waterproof cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a company in Hong Kong that does Vendor Central so they don\u2019t have to pay taxes in each state whenever they sell in Seller Central. There is all sorts of different scenarios that will affect the decision. Amazon pays for inbound shipping when they order from you in Vendor Central. So if you have a large product that is expensive to ship, you can save a lot of money by using Vendor Central.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are your predictions for 2017 and beyond?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So 2017, third-party sales will still grow from 2016. However, at the same time, Amazon will condense. If you look at their earnings report, the number of items offered for sale has gone down; the number of items fulfilled have gone up. Amazon is clearing up a lot of junk sellers. You have people like Will going through and condensing their listings. Once they get rid of the riff-raff, it\u2019ll be much more simple, and you can tell who the private labelers are that care, and who\u2019s selling junk. Eventually, the junk ones will phase out. The sales of third-party sellers will go up, but the amount of third-party sellers and third-party products may fall over time. So, by the time 2018 rolls around, everyone will try to find a way to differentiate themselves because the third-party selling will become a thing of the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where to find Will:<br \/>\n<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goatconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">goatconsulting.com<br \/>\n<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email him at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:will@goatconsulting.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will@goatconsulting.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a Vendor Central VS Seller Central profit calculator.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wtjern\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@wtjern<br \/>\n<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tjernlund\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facebook.com\/tjernlund<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_25\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=25\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Buying Wholesale for Amazon with Will Tjernlund &#8211;
