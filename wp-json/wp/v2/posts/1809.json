I am always getting legal questions when it comes to selling on Amazon. We have with us CJ Rosenbaum, the founder of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazonsellerslawyer.com\/\">Amazon Sellers Lawyer<\/a>, to help answer some questions about Amazon account suspension<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CJ has been representing entrepreneurs ever since he graduated from law school. He got started with Amazon sellers after client started investigating buying an Amazon based business. After the client managed to buy the business, he immediately had issues with Amazon account suspension and ASINs getting knocked off. He came to CJ because when he tried to find someone for legal help and the only people in the industry were non-lawyer consultant types that didn\u2019t know much about being a seller.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CJ has always enjoyed the challenge of working with entrepreneurs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he looked into, he found that there were really no lawyers involved. So he jumped in with both feet. He went from doing nothing but trying cases in court, to solely focusing on Amazon entrepreneurs. He has grown to four lawyers and six staff in New York. If you use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazonsellerslawyer.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Sellers Lawyer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to handle your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.repricerexpress.com\/what-to-do-if-your-amazon-account-gets-suspended\/\">Amazon account suspension issue<\/a>, you\u2019ll know that whoever works on your case is a college educated paralegal. They are opening offices in London and Dublin and are looking to open an office in Mumbai. They have an office open in Shenzhen, China, with plans to expand into <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guangzhou and Dongguan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Amazon Account Suspension<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number fear of any Amazon seller is an <em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sunkenstone.com\/blog\/amazon-ban\/\">Amazon account suspension<\/a><\/strong><\/em>. Not picking a bad product. Not shipping issues. It\u2019s getting that email that Amazon has suspended your account, they\u2019re holding your money and charging you storage fees. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Account\u00a0suspension can be divided into two categories: non-intellectual property and intellectual property suspension.<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazonsellerslawyer.com\/blog\/intellectual-property-complaints-amazon\/\">Non-intellectual property suspension<\/a> is from late shipments, bad feedback, etc, and are not really legal issues. The other half is solely intellectual property. This is another brand complaining about you as a seller\u00a0and doing a sweep of their listings claiming your violating intellectual property laws. About 95%-98% of the IP, intellectual property, claims, in the US, are entirely baseless. They are bogus complaints meant to thwart competition. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are coming from major brands like Wal-Mart, Samsung, Major League Baseball and other companies from around the world. CJ and his team stand up to these companies. Almost every time, these brands withdraw their complaints. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazonsellerslawyer.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Sellers Lawyer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> don\u2019t charge outrageous fees for this service. If you hire a lawyer to defend you in court, it can quickly cost you tens of thousands of dollars. CJ is looking to get you back to selling without charging you an arm and a leg to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Amazon Account Suspension from Non-IP Complaints<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are not really legal issues, it has more to do with Amazon\u2019s internal regulation. They come from customer complaints about late shipments, bad feedback, and the like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step is to write a plan of action if you find that your account has been suspended because of a non-IP complaint.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A plan of action is a practice in persuasive writing. You\u2019re trying to persuade the person at Amazon to reinstate your selling privileges, rather than asking for more information or saying no. As lawyers, CJ and his team are trained to identify issues and write persuasively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Writing a Plan of Action<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three parts to a plan of action.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Part 1 The root cause.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This doesn\u2019t mean admitting to doing something wrong that you didn\u2019t do. You don\u2019t have to admit to wrongdoing if you didn\u2019t actually do something wrong. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The root cause can usually be something that you can do better to avoid a customer getting a product that they feel is not authentic. You need to look into your account and figure out what cause the customer or Amazon to have an issue with your account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Part 2 The immediate corrective action that you took. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You had a customer that was unhappy for whatever reason. It may have been a bogus complaint, Amazon is still customer focused. So whatever immediate action you took. Whether you gave them a refund or placed the unit, whatever you did to make the customer happy. \u00a0The product may have been perfect and the customer is just trying to get one over on you, still refund or replace the unit. Let them take a small part to protect your account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Part 3 What you\u2019re going to change in your business to prevent future complaints. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are you going to change so Amazon never has to deal with you again? Maybe it\u2019s better packaging, better product quality, or better shipping.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_101\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=101\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Don\u2019t Unnecessarily Admit to Wrongdoing<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There seems to be a knee-jerk reaction when sellers are faced with an Amazon account suspension, to say you did something wrong and apologize. It\u2019s not necessary to admit wrongdoing if you didn\u2019t actually do something wrong. <\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most sellers know, that when you face an Amazon account suspension, you\u2019re writing to product quality or seller performance. They will say yes, no, or ask for more information. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point, if you\u2019re not reinstated, you move on to policy team. Hopefully they say yes. If they say no, you then go to the Jeff Bezos team. They\u2019re suppose to do a top to bottom evaluation and determine if you can sell or not. If they say yes, great. You go back to selling.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What most sellers don\u2019t know, is that if they say no you can use arbitration with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adr.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Arbitration Association<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you are making a lot of money and it\u2019s you business is worth it, you can decide to let a third-party arbitrate it. Here\u2019s the key. It\u2019s going to make this process\u00a0if you admitted to doing something wrong in your plan of action.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make note that this is if you\u2019re selling in the US and it\u2019s a US account. If you\u2019re in the UK, like most of you I presume, you have to go to Luxembourg and it\u2019s a whole other process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Chances of Success<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CJ and his team has a lot of success when dealing with Amazon account suspension. Most of his clients get reinstated at the first level. Some have to go to policy teams and a small portion end up going to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/profile\/jeff-bezos\/\">Jeff Bezos<\/a>\u2019 team where they are also fairly successful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their goal is to get their clients reinstated as quickly as possible. What they have learned from people at Amazon, is that the first plan of action is vital. You have to be concise and persuasive. It gives you a better chance of getting reinstated quickly. It also forms the basis of their future questions and your arguments going forward if it escalates. I really can\u2019t emphasize enough how important that first plan of action is.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Amazon Account Suspension from IP Complaints<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now we\u2019re going to cover the legal side of Amazon account suspension. These are the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazonsellerslawyer.com\/blog\/intellectual-property-complaints\/\">complaints of IP, intellectual property, laws violation from other brands<\/a>. The good news is that almost all these are baseless and are easily dealt with by a letter from a lawyer. <\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step is to take a look at the correspondence from Amazon. At the bottom it will have the name and email of whoever filed the complaint. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazonsellerslawyer.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Sellers Lawyer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will look at the product, how it was packaged, and look at the details on the listing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They usually find that there is no intellectual property copyright violation. Even though Amazon accepted the complaint, there is no violation under the law. They will then send them a letter, as your attorney, and go step by step how there is no copyright violation. Doing this, and maybe a few phone calls, will usually get the company to withdraw the complaint.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes it needs to be escalated.<\/span> They may have be more zealous and explain the potential liability their company faces if they refuse to withdraw the complaint. What that does is attempt to persuade them to withdraw their complaint and build-up the arguments to then submit to Amazon that there is no violation.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Dealing with Manufacturers<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the best time to have a lawyer. The best thing a lawyer can do is help you avoid problems. When you developing products, your number one threat is your own factory. \u00a0There are times when the factory will agree to not make your product for anyone else, and then they do. Now you have other brands competing against you with your own IP. Intellectual property laws are a bit of a grey area in these places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re in China, make sure you\u2019re dealing with a factory in a province, like Shenzhen or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guangzhou, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that is trying to work on their IP issues. There are all these places in Asia, right now, that are battling to see who will be the leader in intellectual property which means they are wanting to protect IP rights and the court will do a better job backing you up.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will want to file for trademarks. Obviously, in the US and the UK, but you also want to file with <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wipo.int\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WIPO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, World Intellectual Property Organization, in the countries where you\u2019re manufacturing, and the countries where your biggest risk is coming from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your contracts are very important. If you\u2019re having a lawyer in the US or the UK write the contracts, they\u2019re writing in that you have to go to court in the US or UK. The factories in China, Thailand, Vietnam, and India don\u2019t care what a US or a UK court orders because it won\u2019t ever touch them. You need to have the court in the country where the factory is and make sure you have the ability to take them to court in their country. That ruling will affect them. That\u2019s where your leverage is in negotiations.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_99\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"_form_101\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=101\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Account Suspension with CJ Rosenbaum Part 1 of 3<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ob23HgV0Qoc&amp;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F157-1.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F157-amazon-account-suspension-cj-rosenbaum%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/157-1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=1809-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/157-1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"157-1.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 29:08 &#8212; 23.7MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_1895\"><div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-1809-3\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" preload=\"none\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/content.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/157_CJ_Rosenbaum_pt_1.mp4?_=3\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/content.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/157_CJ_Rosenbaum_pt_1.mp4\">https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/content.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/157_CJ_Rosenbaum_pt_1.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div><\/div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp4\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast (video): <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/content.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/157_CJ_Rosenbaum_pt_1.mp4\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=1809-video');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/content.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/157_CJ_Rosenbaum_pt_1.mp4\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"157_CJ_Rosenbaum_pt_1.mp4\">Download<\/a> (1.0GB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/video\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/video\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 29:08 &#8212; 23.7MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSShttps:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/content.blubrry.com\/british_amazon_seller\/157_CJ_Rosenbaum_pt_1.mp4Podcast (video): Play in new window | Download (1.0GB)Subscribe: Email | RSSToday\u2019s show is something that I feel is long overdue.
