It could be from a cashflow point of view to other skills and competencies.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h4><b>Why did Terry create this?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Always had a coaching aspect to their business. For business owners, there is a huge need for business owners to understand their financial statements.<\/p>\n<p><b>Example:\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Terry has been coaching for 2 \u00bd years.<\/p>\n<p>He Owns 3 repair shops &#8211; a lot of companies coach you how to run a shop.<\/p>\n<p>Others will teach how to run a dental office.<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t teach creating financial statements, reading financial statements.<\/p>\n<h4>\u00a0<b>CEO2CEO programme (Chief Everything Officer to Chief Executive Officer)<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>There are 3 main aims:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Teach people financials.<\/li>\n<li>Teach bankability &#8211; Is it lendable by a bank?<\/li>\n<li>Non-financial things that can affect the value or saleability of the company.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4><b>Teaching financials\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>People need to have correct financial statements and then understand them.<\/p>\n<p>They Teach 8-10 financial ratios.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Teaching bankability<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Create a debt schedule and understand how a bank would view your business.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Non-financial aspects\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>These may not reduce the value of your company so much as make the company unsellable. If you\u2019re counting on this.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Financial statements<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Primarily income statement and balance sheets.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Key Ratios<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><b>Current ratio &#8211; <\/b>current assets divided by current liabilities. You want that around a 2.<\/p>\n<p><b>Accounts receivable days<\/b> &#8211; how long it takes you to get paid.<\/p>\n<p><b>The accounts payable days<\/b> &#8211; how long it takes you to pay suppliers.<\/p>\n<p><b>Inventory days<\/b> &#8211; how many days do it take you to flip your inventory?<\/p>\n<h4><b>Which Profit ratios really matter?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s NOT about sales and net income. It\u2019s about gross margin and cash flow.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Gross profit margin is<\/b>\u00a0<strong>really important.\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If your sales are going up but your gross margin is going down, you are absorbing expenses.<\/p>\n<p><b>Cashflow margin<\/b> &#8211; is it staying consistent or going up or down?<\/p>\n<p>Again, if your gross margin is going up but this isn\u2019t, you are adding a lot of overhead.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Traditional accounting issues<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The traditional accounting compares sales and net income from one period in one year to a comparable period in the previous year, eg. Jan 2020 cf. last Jan 2019. This is not useful in Terry\u2019s eyes.<\/p>\n<p>You need to look at the monthly trend.<\/p>\n<h4><b>How do the Accounts Receivable (AR) and Accounts Payable (AP) matter?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>If you have a cash shortage, you may need a line of credit etc. to fund that.<\/p>\n<p>So, 27 AR, 12 AP &#8211; had 15 days to fund before received cash.<\/p>\n<p>With $100K a day in sales, 15 days = $1.5 Million is needed.<\/p>\n<p>If you doubled the sales, you\u2019d need $3 Million to fund that.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Working Capital\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>This is the cash you need to fund the day to day activities of your company.<\/p>\n<p>If your AR days are 30 and that\u2019s $0.5M, you\u2019ll have bills in that time period, how much money do you need to cover that gap?<\/p>\n<h4><b>Cashflow planning<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The amount of cash you need in your company is a CRITICAL number so you NEVER run out of cash.<\/p>\n<p>You can be profitable and go out of business if you don\u2019t understand the working capital needs of the business.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Bankability<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><b>Growth requires a lot more working capital!\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Growing too fast can actually make a bank judge a company negatively.<\/p>\n<p>A friend of Terry\u2019s has a blue-collar company &#8211; he didn\u2019t understand the financial statements!<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve got to get the financial statements.<\/p>\n<p>Your debt schedule depends on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What was the loan amount?<\/li>\n<li>Collateral?<\/li>\n<li>Monthly payments?<\/li>\n<li>When is the loan due?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This gets to the <b>debt service ratio<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>Say you take a 20-year loan out on a property.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re 15 years in, you might be able to refinance that loan to get expansion money for your company.<\/p>\n<p>They borrowed $100K for the company but refinanced the debt and LOWERED his payments by $6K a month<\/p>\n<h4><b>Debt service ratio<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Typically banks will lend on 1.25 multiple (ie. net cashflow is 1.25X loan repayments).<\/p>\n<p>Terry prefers to see 1.7X multiple.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Balance Sheet =collateral for bank<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>This often plays a large part in funding growth or acquisitions.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Choosing the right bank<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Banks vary.<\/p>\n<p>Some don\u2019t loan on restaurants.<\/p>\n<p>And some banks don\u2019t loan on owner-occupied real estate.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Understand what a bank loan officer is thinking<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>It boils down to collateral and cashflow!<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to ask the bankers what they DO want to see!<\/p>\n<p>If for example, they want to see a current ratio above 1, ask them!<\/p>\n<p>Same with collateral &#8211; Terry would say he had $1M worth of trucks but the bank would discount it by $700K. You need to know how the bank will view your collateral.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Communicate your plans to your banker.\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Terry used to meet with his banker at the start of each year.<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019d layout plans and give them a heads-up on any initiatives for the year.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Always have a plan B for your Bank<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Banks change lending policies every so often.<\/p>\n<p>They may no longer be lending to your industry any more.<\/p>\n<p>Back in the day, Terry had real estate loans from one Bank, used a second Bank for business loans and a third bank for other purposes.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Non-financial aspects<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Aim for \u201c<b>The Switzerland situation<\/b>\u201d &#8211; independent of all aspects.<\/p>\n<p>Terry had one big customer &#8211; ran 50 trucks, 10,000 gallons of fuel a week.<\/p>\n<p>He had ONE customer &#8211; the customer responsible for 100% of revenue.<\/p>\n<p>That is NOT a place you want to be in!<\/p>\n<h4><b>The Hub and Spoke<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Are you the hub of your company?<\/p>\n<p>If so, if we remove you from your company, will it no longer function?<\/p>\n<p>You need to continuously pull yourself out of the company.<\/p>\n<p>The acid test: Can you go on vacation for 2 weeks and company survive?<\/p>\n<p>If you are intimately involved, whoever buys the company will need to be.<\/p>\n<p>That means that you may have serious issues trying to sell the company at all.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Recurring Revenue<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Companies with recurring revenue ALWAYS sell more than transactional revenue.<\/p>\n<p>If you sell coffee, people drink coffee every morning.<\/p>\n<p>Fuel is similar for farmers.<\/p>\n<p>(A disadvantage of a brokerage company, like Terry\u2019s,\u00a0 is that it\u2019s very transactional, for example).<\/p>\n<p>There are all kinds of subscriptions you can build in.<\/p>\n<p>Eg.
