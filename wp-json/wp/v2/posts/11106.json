My name is Aabhas Vijay and I am the founder of www.SMTPServers.co where we teach <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cience.com\/blog\/b2b-sales-email-guide-how-to-nail-a-cold-email-campaign\">marketing automation and email marketing hacks.\u00a0<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s begin the journey to find out how to make the most <\/span><b>use of Email Campaigns for your online store<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? In this post, I will tell you everything about it so you can start right away. Let\u2019s dive in!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s start by defining what is a transactional email?: it is the email<\/span><b> that is sent automatically after a transaction<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I mean, a sale? Yes, but not only that. Now you might be thinking what does an online store owner have to do with transactional emails?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, remember some people\u2019s use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smtpservers.co\/blog\/free-smtp-servers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SMTP Servers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to send free transactional emails in an eCommerce store, You can use a dedicated email server if you have thousands of subscribers.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see all the different <\/span><b>type of Campaigns <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in an online store which is automated and are transactional emails :<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welcome email (associated with a new user registration).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abandoned cart emails<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order summary email.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment email accepted.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email of problems with the payment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abandoned cart recovery email.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A confirmation email that your order has been shipped.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer feedback email (how was everything?).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Password reset email.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you email.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An email with automatic responses from support\/customer service.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, there are more, but these are the main Email Campaigns that can be sent to <\/span><b>retain our customers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and or help them make a purchase. There is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/ecommerce-email-formula\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">definitive way to write an email<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and you should keep it in mind whenever you are sending emails.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How to sell more with Email Marketing?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In email marketing, in order to sell more and generate trust in the user, <\/span><b>you should never miss out on opportunities<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to interact with your subscribers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the ways which you can use to improve your eCommerce sales with the help of email marketing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Send Relevant information about the order<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The details of what one bought, how he\/she paid for it, how long will it take to reach its destination, the link to download the invoice, and even the tracking ID of the order. This will help you make a healthy relationship with your shoppers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Contact information<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is extremely crucial to make your shoppers know how to reach you. This builds a sense of belongingness and trust between seller and customer. Most importantly, customers feel safe when they know that they can contact you whenever required. In case of any kind of any discrepancy,\u00a0 provide them with choices to contact you such as email, phone, fax, WhatsApp, Line, Skype, Chat, or whatever.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Link to your website and the sections that may create interest\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linking back to your website will increase your scope. For example, A direct link to the page where one can monitor one\u2019s order can be included in your email. This will make it easier for clients to use your website. It is a great way of generating traffic and on the page, you can also show them the previous products that they viewed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Generate Trust<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We use great secure payment platforms. Importantly, SSL encryption of our website is also secure. Clients have always found our website reliable and helpful, we hold strong feedback. Hence, I believe that it should be put in the Email to <\/span><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.redalkemi.com\/blog\/post\/how-to-build-consumer-trust-in-the-digital-marketing-environment\">reinforce the client&#8217;s trust<\/a><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! It will help strengthen the confidence of the customer!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This point yields little direct results, however they boost profits by spreading faith in the mind of your shoppers and in the long turn in your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Incentive for future purchases<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transactional emails appear to have a higher open rate than newsletters when they are in sync with an urgent action that the subscriber has just taken. It helps in engaging customers more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also serve as a good tool to provide promotional vouchers, promotional deals, partner and\/or support schemes, etc. with exposure. Transactional emails are like a direct conversation with customers. In this article, I have pointed some <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smtpservers.co\/blog\/transactional-email\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free transactional email providers<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><b>Promote up selling and cross selling<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These emails are a safe place to encourage, promote and advertise <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.palbin.com\/es\/blog\/post\/210\/cross-selling-y-up-selling-2-tecnicas-para-vender-mas-en-tu-ecommerce\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">up-selling and cross-selling<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, suggesting users, <\/span><b>products related to the purchase they have just made or viewed in the past <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(if you know about it, you can filter those products according to category).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Bonus track<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My recommendation in your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshrelevance.com\/complete-guide-to-cart-abandonment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cart retrieval emails<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to concentrate on closing the deal. What does it entail? <\/span><b>Stretch as far as you can with the rope.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe in providing <\/span><b>benefits such as discounts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: (although it is a dangerous strategy since you can enter the dynamic of always abandoning the cart to get that discount). Free shipping can be another opportunity. Here is an article that I have written to help you use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smtpservers.co\/blog\/autoresponders\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free autoresponders<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and setting up abandoned cart emails using these autoresponders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Place a simple, prominent call to action (CTA) that unambiguously leads the customer to the action that you want them to take. Please make sure that you have nailed your emails in order to create an impact, CTA alignment, structure, colors everything should be strategically thought after so that it can persuade your buyers, if you have a budget please hire a graphic design service like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/delesign.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delesign<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mailbakery.com\/\">mailbakery<\/a>,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another very significant advice is <\/span><b>not to overdo it immediately<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: do not send an abandoned cart email as soon as they leave the cart, first send a reminder mail after 4-5 hours, then wait for another 12 hours if still no action is taken send an email with similar items, and a third email after 24 hours which offers a discount for a limited time period, on the products they have left in the cart.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have used this technique to get more conversions. The aim is to remind each prospect not only of the cart they have left but also of the key market advantages and<\/span><b> exclusive selling proposals: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free delivery for each order, a gift card, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This emphasizes the decision-making of each buyer, but if you introduce an <\/span><b>opportunity with a time accelerator<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, &#8220;that X discount or X offer is valid only for the next 24 hours&#8221; it could boost conversion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hope these techniques help you get more conversions, I have been using them since the beginning of my career and have helped numerous e-commerce companies to increase their sales using email marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Author Bio &#8211; Aabhas Vijay is the founder of an email marketing blog www.smtpservers.co that teaches how to use a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smtpservers.co\/blog\/free-smtp-servers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> free SMTP<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to scale small &amp; medium businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you own an eCommerce store?
