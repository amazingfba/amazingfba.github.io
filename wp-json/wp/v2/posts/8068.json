And no longer enjoying the events<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Sold that business.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>What made you decide to go into selling on Amazon?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Didn\u2019t enjoy job that much! Was tied to one place.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Googled \u201cHow to make money online\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Things like crypto-currency and drop shipping sounded spammy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then came across Amazon. It sounded like you could build a proper online retail business.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Current results<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Selling around 12-13K<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>in Feb 2020 (from first selling this product line in June 2018)<\/p>\n<p>This is in the USA but Teddy is set to expand into the UK in 2020.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Testing the water<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Set aside \u00a31000 to test.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Teddy used Jungle Scout million dollar case study blog.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Showed all the steps needed to create the product.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Classic pattern:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\">Find a product on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alibaba.com\"><span class=\"s1\">Alibaba<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Redesign it in some way,<\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Put your own branding on it.<\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Sell on Amazon<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p2\">Found an air freshener made of bamboo and charcoal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Not much profit and competitive.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Didn\u2019t cost too much and got money back.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But didn\u2019t really want to get into an area of such high competition.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It also didn\u2019t excite Teddy<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>What insights did you get from that test?<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\">Quite a big supplier, he organised our shipping for-<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>for someone just starting, very helpful.<\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">But also taught about how to do shipping codes<\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">How to create photos, inc infographics.<\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Shipped products to Serbia and got them photographed<\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">But could do own photography and a good photo shopper<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>How did you decide what products to sell?<\/b><\/h2>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\">While initial product was being made in China, realised things were made elsewhere.<\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Thought it might be competitive advantage to source elsewhere.<\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Considered a whole load of places &#8211; Looked at India and Vietnam were<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>&#8211; but these were where<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rwb.global\/event\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Retail without Borders<\/a> podcast<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Looked into sourcing websites for handicrafts etc.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ended up finding a few suppliers that did high-quality stuff<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Teddy\u2019s first product handmade in Vietnam &#8211; didn\u2019t visit Vietnam.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Wished had done as did visit India &#8211; found it a great way to do it &#8211; found<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Finding the kind of product to sell<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Websites and profiles showed the kind of products they made.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That showed what was out there.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They knew they wanted to be in homeware space and design.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Used what found THEN did research.<\/p>\n<h3>Researching OFF Amazon<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Eg Teddy sees what is selling well on John Lewis &#8211; a lot of them have reviews on them.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then looks on Amazon and see if something similar was on there.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Another benefit is that big companies spend a lot of money on design so you\u2019re getting a lot of design.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>If something was on John Lewis but not on Amazon, that could be a great product.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Originally used the JS chrome extension -which still uses<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Also used the web app but thought lots of people are seeing it too.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>Partnership &#8211; with fianc\u00e9e<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Don\u2019t talk about Amazon in bed but do talk about it in the evenings!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So they do have to work in the evenings but it\u2019s not that difficult.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Splitting up tasks<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Michael Gerber: The e-Myth is a big favourite of Teddy\u2019s<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\">Fianc\u00e9e doing operations side<\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Teddy doing marketing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p2\">So the aim is to run things like a \u201cproper business\u201d &#8211; and to create a &#8220;brand&#8221; ie a name\u00a0 that consumers recognise.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Starting budget <\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Started with around \u00a37000 (plus \u00a31000 for the test product), which \u00a0included first and second order.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They have added in a bit of capital &#8211; but most of the investment has come from the profits.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">If they want to grow a bit faster, they\u2019d need to invest more or borrow more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Might borrow money from parents.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Off Amazon marketing or selling?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Started Shopify website but no sales yet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Amazon seller support may be bad but Shopify is bad too!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Going to start pushing some traffic.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Are you working this alongside the day job?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Quit job last Jan 2019.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Had Photo Booth business &#8211;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Sold business as was no longer enjoying it.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Consultant for an e-commerce consultancy<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Doesn\u2019t have a day job at the moment but works for another company that has a few project managers and is an accountant manager.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Most of the clients have no Amazon presence at all &#8211; building it up from scratch.<br \/>\nA lot are big brands off Amazon doing a few million a year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That includes PPC, copy. Like being an Amazon business owner<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Teddy is a digital nomad although lives in London.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So a remote job was really helpful.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Boss is English but lives in Vietnam!<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>Plans and the future<\/b><\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Where are you wanting to go in a few years\u2019 time?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">It would be great to get the business to a point where it COULD be sold.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Even if chooses not to. Not sure what the numbers look like.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><b>Meanwhile in 2020<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Immediate Aim: Teddy and fianc\u00e9e working on the business together and not having jobs. Her job is based in London so they want to become location independent.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trying to professionalise it at the moment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Introducing Virtual assistants.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But Teddy happy doing work as a consultant so not rushing to leave.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><b>Virtual assistants<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">The bottom level of structure has very specific roles<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\">Reporting eg monthly report<\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Running PPC<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p2\">Teddy is trying to get VAs into those roles so they can take a strategic look at PPC.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Teddy is not very good at the detail of that.
