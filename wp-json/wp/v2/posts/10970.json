Did you know that the conversion rate in e-commerce is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdmarketing.com\/grow-profits-without-depending-on-google-facebook-ecommerce-email-strategies\/\">3x higher via email<\/a> than via other channels? Not to mention that the average order value for an email offer is 20% higher. Yes, email marketing is that powerful. And having the right eCommerce Email Formula will really help you tap into that power.<\/p>\n<p>So, you should just send emails to your subscribers, and that&#8217;s it, right?<\/p>\n<p>Well, not quite.<\/p>\n<p>How you approach the <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/creating-email-series-around-the-lead-magnet-with-rob-patterson-from-aweber\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">email copywriting,<\/a> and your ability to keep recipients interested is crucial. If you want to achieve a high conversion rate, boost your sales, and grow brand loyalty, you need proven formulas for writing emails.<\/p>\n<p>Why formulas? Because they set the groundwork and provide you with a framework that actually works. They&#8217;ll save you from failed attempts and establish email copywriting efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Having several copywriting formulas at your disposal will give email subscribers some variety and keep them engaged. You&#8217;ll also get a chance to try out different formulas and stick with the ones that work best for your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>With that being said, let&#8217;s jump straight to tested, analyzed, and proven three best formulas for e-commerce emails.<\/p>\n<h2>eCommerce Email Formula No. 1: AIDCA<\/h2>\n<p>AIDA or <em>Attention, Interest, Desire, Conviction, Action<\/em> formula is a well-known eCommerce email formula among experienced copywriters. Many have relied on its impeccable ability to win over consumers. However, this AIDA formula that you are about to get to know is tailored to fit the needs of e-commerce <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smtpservers.co\/blog\/email-marketing-best-practices\/\">email marketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A<\/strong>ttention \u2013 The formula starts with grabbing readers&#8217; attention. Typically this is where an <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/clickable-email-subject-line-types\/\">effective subject line<\/a> comes into the picture. The preview text is another relevant, attention-grabbing tool.<\/li>\n<li><strong>I<\/strong>nterest \u2013 Build anticipation and evoke interest with the first few lines of the email. Simply answer the question \u2013 <em>What would interest my target audience?<\/em> One of the ways of building interest is by presenting a problem that your audience typically encounters.<\/li>\n<li><strong>D<\/strong>esire \u2013 The main role of the email is to spark a desire. Depending on the type of email (sales, nurture, engagement emails), the desire is created by offering an amazing deal, engaging recipients with surveys, or captivating them with your brand story.<\/li>\n<li><strong>C<\/strong>onviction \u2013 Eliminate any doubts that the recipients might have. If you are promoting a product, add reviews, if you want them to take a survey, offer exclusive blog posts as an incentive \u2013 simply add onto their desire with a convincing reason to take action.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A<\/strong>ction \u2013 The formula is solidified with a CTA (call-to-action) button.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can use this formula within a single email, but you can also spread it out across a sequence of emails.<\/p>\n<h2>Formula No. 2: PAS<\/h2>\n<p><em>Problem, Agitate, Solve,<\/em> or PAS formula, our second eCommerce email formula, can do wonders in e-commerce. What are products other than solutions to a problem? Your role in this framework will be to point out that problem and offer a solution in the form of your product. But let&#8217;s look closely at the structure of this formula.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>P<\/strong>roblem \u2013 Put yourself in the customers&#8217; shoes and portray the problem that frustrates them. A problem that can be solved with your product. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/309628\">The storytelling technique<\/a> is a good method for presenting the problem. For example, if the solution is an ergonomic sleeping pillow, start with the story whose main characters are back pain, restless nights, and poor quality of sleep.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A<\/strong>gitate \u2013 Reach the climax of your story with agitating examples of inefficient solutions that customers have tried out. You can mention the amount of money they&#8217;ve spent on various products or anticipate potential consequences if they don&#8217;t find an adequate solution.<\/li>\n<li><strong>S<\/strong>olve \u2013 This is where your product steps in as the savior. Be specific about what makes your product different from the rest and why it can be the answer to their prayers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maximize the potential of this formula with some compelling images. Adding infographics that back up your product&#8217;s efficiency, before\/after images, and similar visuals can boost the recipients&#8217; engagement.<\/p>\n<p>As you can easily get carried away while painting the picture of the problem and solution, make sure that you properly edit the content you use in the formula. Hire a professional editor or if you are confident in your skills, check the content&#8217;s comprehensiveness with <a href=\"https:\/\/readable.com\/\">Readable<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hemingwayapp.com\/\">Hemingway Editor<\/a> online tools.<\/p>\n<p>If you are intrigued by the storytelling technique, but you don&#8217;t have the experience, you can always collaborate with writing services such as <a href=\"https:\/\/wowgrade.net\/\">WowGrade<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trustmypaper.com\/\">TrustMyPaper<\/a>. They can set the structure for the storytelling that you can reuse for different emails created with the PAS formula.<\/p>\n<h2>Formula No. 3: 4Ps<\/h2>\n<p>Another one of the digital marketers&#8217; favorites is the 4Ps formula \u2013 Promise, Paint, Proof, Push.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>P<\/strong>romise \u2013 Begin with a bang, not a whimper. Immediately offer a promise of fulfilling your target audience&#8217;s desire. Whether your readers are <a href=\"https:\/\/3to5marketing.com\/android-browsers-for-android\/\">Android software developers<\/a> or business owners, there is a deep desire they want to fulfill. For example, the promise can look something like this, &#8220;Your social media campaign can be so amazing that you increase your followers rate in 24 hours!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>P<\/strong>aint \u2013 Further elaborate on the promise you&#8217;ve made. What are the benefits? To add to the previously mentioned example, you can explain how new followers will bring them more sales. Really present what the target audience wants to achieve and, more importantly \u2013 present it as something that can be realized.<\/li>\n<li><strong>P<\/strong>roof \u2013 Show your audience that you don&#8217;t make empty promises by providing them with proof of your efficiency. That proof can come in the form of testimonials, statistics, images of happy customers, success stories, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>P<\/strong>ush \u2013 You&#8217;ve got the audience excited, you&#8217;ve gained their trust, and now you need to push them to take the leap. Reinforce your promise with a CTA that ensures the recipients that the world you described is within their reach. Instead of a simple &#8220;Get started,&#8221; opt for &#8220;Get started now and watch how your number of followers rapidly grows.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The 4Ps <a href=\"https:\/\/flywriting.com\/write-a-killer-e-commerce-copy\/\">copywriting technique<\/a> provides you with a framework that aims to excite readers about the solution. With the image of a better tomorrow that your product creates, they won&#8217;t be able to resist the temptation.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>These formulas can give your emails a bulletproof structure. You won&#8217;t have to struggle with trying out different email forms and chasing away your customers with dull emails. Go straight to these three copywriting formulas that have proven efficiency.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Diana Nadim Adjadj, Freelance Writer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>BIO:<\/strong> <em>Diana Nadim is a writer and editor who has a Master&#8217;s degree in Marketing.
