This post will be part one of the journey.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>First up, the downsides:<\/p>\n<h2>It Takes Longer Than Most People Say It Will, to Launch a Private Label Product<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re looking at 6-9 months to turn an idea into a product on Amazon. Typically you\u2019re working with manufacturers in China, and it takes time to send samples back and forth. Production times are slower; numbers are more significant. It\u2019s not advisable to rush into Private Label. Take your time.<\/p>\n<p>It Takes More Time Than Most People Say. If you want to get a private label product out in 5-10 hours a week, good luck. It is going to take you at least 10-15 hours a week. That\u2019s only a couple hours a day, but juggling 10-15 hours a week on top of all the other daily responsibilities in your life could be tough.<\/p>\n<p>It Often Takes More Money Too.You could start with \u00a33,000, but I\u2019d suggest at least \u00a35,000. I know &#8211;\u00a0 that\u2019s a lot of money. If you don\u2019t have that kind of capital, it\u2019s ok. You can start with something like retail arbitrage or merch by Amazon with little to no capital investment at all.Just don&#8217;t try to private label with an inadequate budget.<\/p>\n<h2>Your First Product May Not Take Off<\/h2>\n<p>This is a reality of the business in. Not all products sell. As long as you don\u2019t spend all your money on that first product\u2013which wouldn\u2019t be advisable anyway\u2013you\u2019ll be okay.<\/p>\n<h3>The Biggest Markets aren\u2019t Always the Best Markets<\/h3>\n<p>People get excited about all the high revenue numbers they see, especially in the USA. The truth is, if you\u2019ve got a market that\u2019s selling 40, 50 or even $60,000 per listing per month, you may need 20, 30, 40 or even $50,000 to launch into and compete in that market. High selling markets typically require more capital to get moving.<\/p>\n<h3>Amazon will Sometimes Take a Week to Sort Out What Should Take One Phone Call<\/h3>\n<p>It often seems you\u2019ll spend a week or more dealing with a problem that would take an intelligent person five minutes to solve.<\/p>\n<h3>Seller Central Often Knows Less Than You Do..<\/h3>\n<p>That\u2019s a reality of working with Amazon. They outsource their service, and many times the people on the other side of the phone know less about your problem than you do. This is why it\u2019s so important to get help from people who genuinely know what they\u2019re doing.<\/p>\n<p>They Also Contradict One Another..Inconsistency is something you\u2019re going to experience when working with Amazon. It\u2019s not a tight-knit company. Many people are competing with each other for resources. It\u2019s not going to be a consistent environment when you\u2019re working with Seller Central.<\/p>\n<p>Giant Facebook Groups Won\u2019t Help You Solve Your Problems.This is obvious. There are a lot of myths and rumors when it comes to Amazon because they keep a lot of their information close to their chest. You need people who have the experience to help you.<\/p>\n<h2>You Can\u2019t Market Your Way Out of a Poor Niche Product Selection<\/h2>\n<p>If you choose to sell baby wipes on Amazon, you\u2019re in competition with Pampers, Huggies, and some HUGE brand names. You\u2019re not going to be able to market your way out of it with good brand pictures, great bullet points and pay per click Amazon ads. These brands dominate the market. Their unit costs are incredibly low. They will beat you on the money every time.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/visa-3082813_640.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"4199\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/241-fba-business\/visa-3082813_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/visa-3082813_640.jpg?fit=640%2C449&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,449\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"visa-3082813_640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/visa-3082813_640.jpg?fit=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/visa-3082813_640.jpg?fit=640%2C449&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4199 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/visa-3082813_640-300x210.jpg?resize=300%2C210\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/visa-3082813_640.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/visa-3082813_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>But it\u2019s not all bad. There are some considerable upsides to selling products on Amazon as well:<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>It\u2019s Quicker to get Started Selling on Amazon Than Many People Say<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m not talking about big runs of private label products. That\u2019s slow. You can literally just pick up your iPhone, scan them into the seller app, and get the ball rolling. If you sell it FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon), you\u2019ll have to learn the process of shipping items to Amazon. This will be great practice for when you expand to private label later on.<\/p>\n<h3>Passive Income from an FBA Business<\/h3>\n<p>Barring a bit of customer service, once you have some stock up and selling on Amazon, this truly is passive income. Later on, when you have tens or even hundreds of product lines, it gets a bit more active, but when you\u2019re first starting out, it really is passive.<\/p>\n<h3>Looking at the Seller App is Addictive<\/h3>\n<p>Once you get the hang of the ins and outs of Amazon and Fulfillment by Amazon, it\u2019s quite fun.<\/p>\n<h3>Nothing Beats Selling 100 Units in a Day<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve experienced this a few times. It\u2019s a fantastic feeling. Best of all, I\u2019ve done nothing (Talk about passive.) if I\u2019ve got my products in an Amazon Warehouse selling FBA. If you\u2019re selling your products FBM (Fulfilled by Merch), you\u2019re going to find that it\u2019s a lot of hard work. I don\u2019t suggest this.<\/p>\n<h3>You\u2019ll be Joining a Community of Fellow Online Nerds<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you like it or not, you\u2019re going to be part of a community of people who are getting quite precise about numbers and online trends. Most people don\u2019t know the tidal wave that\u2019s coming toward them. It\u2019s called \u201conline everything.\u201d That includes retail, and we\u2019re still at the front of the trend. Most people still don\u2019t even buy online.<\/p>\n<h3>Masterminds are inspiring &amp; VERY effective<\/h3>\n<p>Masterminds made up of people who actually sell stuff are the best source of information. Facebook groups of people who don\u2019t sell stuff are just parroting the talking points they\u2019ve heard in the Amazon echo chamber.<\/p>\n<h3>98.2% of Seller accounts Opened in 2016 Were Closed or Dormant by the End of the Year.<\/h3>\n<p>Most people give up. That\u2019s great news if you\u2019re one of the 1.8% that doesn\u2019t. The vast majority of your competition will disappear overnight.<\/p>\n<h3>I know about 30 Amazon sellers who are selling over \u00a3100k a year on Amazon.<\/h3>\n<p>Not counting \u201cGurus\u201d I\u2019ve interviewed, I know 30+ sellers with over \u00a3100k of sales on Amazon a year.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/10k-collective-membership-application\/\">The $10k Collective<\/a>\u00a0members are all individually selling at least \u00a3100k a year -in some cases over \u00a33m. All on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>Added together, the $10K Collective members should sell over \u00a310 million this year on Amazon.That\u2019s a very conservative figure. We have one person targeting \u00a312 million in turnover this year, and his growth curve suggests he\u2019ll do it.<\/p>\n<p>This road is going to be bumpy. Welcome to the life of an entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<p>If you want a smooth ride, get yourself an education from an Ivy league school like Harvard, \u00a0or Cambridge and Oxford in the UK. Then get a job as a lawyer. Or try to. Even that will likely have its ups and downs. (Most law graduates for example never even get a training contract as a solicitor for example in the UK).<\/p>\n<p>Actually &#8211; there&#8217;s no such thing as a smooth ride through life, unless you are just lucky. And even then, luck has a habit of running out at some point.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of us accept that good things are worth some sweat.<\/p>\n<p>We have people in the<a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/10k-collective-membership-application\/\"> $10k Collective <\/a>that started a year ago that are already doing tens of thousands a month in profitable income. Not everyone is going to get these results, but with enough hard work and time put in, you can do it too.<\/p>\n<p>This opportunity is still tremendous. If you\u2019re serious about it you can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re just getting started and aren\u2019t ready for anything close to the $10k Collective, join a mastermind. <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/private-label-mastermind-zero-to-hero\/\">Zero to Hero<\/a> is perfect for you if you live in the UK and can get to London once a month.<\/p>\n<p>Whoever you choose, I urge you to join a mastermind at all costs. It is THE key difference between success and failure, in my personal experience.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch FBA Business Reality &#8211; Amazon Private Label Life part 1<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xTVlqNFhPv8&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F241.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F241-fba-business%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/241.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=4197-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/241.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"241.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 19:39 &#8212; 16.1MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 19:39 &#8212; 16.1MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSToday I want to share some of the realities of selling on Amazon and starting your own FBA business.
