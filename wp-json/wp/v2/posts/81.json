Not in itself a great safety check, but check how long supplier has been listed. The longer, the better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Assessed Supplier &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>Which I called &#8220;Verified Supplier&#8221; in the Podcast. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alibaba.com\/help\/trustworthy_faq_what_assessed.html\">Here <\/a>is Alibaba&#8217;s explanation. Basically, a 3rd party inspection company has been in to check their claims are true and that it looks like a legitimate business. Of course, this being China, we can&#8217;t be absolutely certain\u00a0of the integrity\u00a0the 3rd party, but it&#8217;s another level of check.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Onsite Check &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>on\u00a0a laptop\/desktop, this only seems to show in the sidebar on the Alibaba site. This means they physically check the factory, which is obviously a lot better than just checking the paperwork.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Certificates &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>again, in\u00a0the sidebar. For certain products, you&#8217;ll need certification for the product. E.g. 1, silicone spatula touches food so it will need FDA (Food &amp; Drug Administration) approval in USA.<br \/>\nE.g. 2, electric lamp as an electrical item will possibly need certification (More in<a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/8\"> episode #8<\/a> \u00a0how to find out what certification is needed).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_69\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=69\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<strong>ALTERNATIVES TO ALIBABA.COM<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/HKDTC.com\">HKTDC.com<\/a> (Hong Kong Trade Development Corporation).

I don&#8217;t recommend that, but their blog (linked above) and their free email series are useful guides.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/provenchinasourcing.com\/\">Proven China Sourcing<\/a> (eBook) by Walter Hay &amp; Jim Cockrum. This site is a sales page for &#8220;Proven China Sourcing&#8221;. It costs $97 USD. I bought it and I must say it is no B.S. precise information. But there is a lot to absorb and implement so I only recommend it if you are going to have time to do things thoroughly. If you try to implement everything in this eBook, and can only work it very part-time, you will possibly delay things by months &#8211; more or less the trap I fell into.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Glossary of\u00a0Technical Terms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>MOQ &#8211; <\/strong>Minimum Order Quantity &#8211; the lowest number of units that a supplier is prepared to produce in one order.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pieces-\u00a0<\/strong>this is simply the Chinese preferred word for &#8220;Units&#8221;, i.e., the number of &#8220;copies&#8221; of a given product line to be produced. \u00a0Abbreviated to &#8220;pcs&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Private Label Product &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>A product produced by a manufacturer who will put your logo on the product and\/or your design on the packaging. The same as &#8220;White Label Product&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>This is the essence of the business model that I use and that for example Amazing Selling Machine promotes. That&#8217;s because it is technically a &#8220;new&#8221; product so you can use a new UPC (product code) on Amazon and have a unique product so nobody else can compete for the &#8220;Buy Box&#8221; (more on this in future episodes). Also you are building your brand every time you sell a unit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OEM &#8211;<\/strong>In normal usage with Chinese suppliers, it means the same as &#8220;Private Labelled&#8221;, ie with your own logo and\/or packaging design.<\/p>\n<p>In theory, OEM\u00a0stands for &#8220;Original Equipment Manufacturer&#8221;. Also in theory, it refers to your own design being produced by a factory. Technically the alternative term for Private Labelling\u00a0should be &#8220;ODM&#8221; but I&#8217;ve yet to find a\u00a0Chinese supplier who uses that term.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FREIGHT INCOTERMS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Freight\u00a0is dealt with in more detail\u00a0in <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/9\/\">Episode #9<\/a>, but\u00a0I thought it worth putting this in here as you&#8217;ll need to understand what prices you&#8217;re being quoted during the phase of looking for suppliers and negotiating.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logisticsmgepsupv.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/incoterms-1.jpg\">&#8220;Incoterms&#8221; <\/a>are internationally agreed freight terms<b>. <\/b>Chinese Suppliers are familiar with some of these, although as ever, they tend to use them in their own way.<\/p>\n<p>There are 11 incoterms, each with a unique 3-letter abbreviation. The most important thing each does is: to\u00a0define\u00a0precisely when the responsibility for the shipment passes from the Seller to the Buyer. You can further split that into Risks, Responsibility and Costs but I don&#8217;t believe\u00a0you should overthink this at this stage of knowledge!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logisticsmgepsupv.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/incoterms-1.jpg\">Here&#8217;s a chart\u00a0<\/a>showing the detail. The good news is that there are only 3 incoterms you&#8217;ll probably need to discuss or understand:<\/p>\n<p><strong>EXW<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;Ex Works&#8221; &#8211; this is the price straight from the Factory Gates. I would never advise you buying on these terms because it means you would have to engage a Freight Forwarder to get the product through all the hoops (clear Chinese customs, get put on board plane, get freight plane over to USA, clear USA customs, etc. etc). But as it involves basically no Freight, it means you have a like-for-like comparison for price between different suppliers if you want to be extra thorough.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FOB &#8211; &#8220;Free on Board&#8221; &#8211; <\/strong>The Seller will pay for Land transport to the port, export customs, and loading on board the ship.\u00a0This technically can only be used with Sea Freight but the Chinese use it all the time for sea\u00a0or air freight.<\/p>\n<p>This is a very common way of quoting price but I still\u00a0think this leaves way too much for you to organise (international freight, clearing US customs, unloading in US Port, \u00a0organising freight within the USA to your warehouse etc.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>DAP &#8211; &#8220;Delivered At Place&#8221;\u00a0<\/strong>&#8211; sometimes (incorrectly) called &#8220;DDU&#8221; &#8211; Delivered Duty Unpaid (I am guilty of using this term too, possibly influenced by one of my suppliers!).<\/p>\n<p>This means the supplier undertakes to do everything necessary to deliver your products from their factory door directly to your warehouse, EXCEPT for clearing U.S. customs and paying U.S. import duty.<\/p>\n<p>This is the method I have used so far with both\u00a0of my current suppliers and all my imports (6 to date). I like it because it takes care of most of the issues, but it still can leave you holding the baby with the U.S. customs.<\/p>\n<p>If you use this method, you will almost certainly get a better freight rate than if you asked for it yourself. That&#8217;s because your supplier ships probably 100X more volume per month than you are importing. However, you can check this by opening an account yourself with DHL or whoever they use for freight, and getting a quote for air freight to your warehouse address.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DHL\/Fedex or UPS only, folks!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really important if you use this method to only work with a supplier who will work with one of the standard courier companies: DHL, Fedex or UPS. That&#8217;s because of customs clearance in the USA. If you set up your own (company&#8217;s) account with DHL, they can pay for duty and customs charges upfront and will invoice you or charge you directly for it. This means you don&#8217;t need a customs broker to clear U.S. customs.<\/p>\n<p>If you allow your supplier to use any courier company that uses a normal airline, you will \u00a0need to use a customs broker, meaning more costs and more complications for you. SPELL OUT to them that they are not to do this! Guess how I learnt about this!<\/p>\n<p><strong>DDP- &#8220;Delivered Duty Paid&#8221; &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>This is the De luxe and simplest of all Freight terms &#8211; your supplier will pay for and be responsible for everything from their factory gates up to your warehouse gates. I haven&#8217;t yet found a supplier who is willing to supply on this basis, but if you can find one, I totally recommend this unless the price is outrageous. It means that you effectively don&#8217;t have to think about the Freight part of your supply chain and avoid any potential complications with the U.S. Customs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Checking Customs quotes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To check the price is reasonable, \u00a0get a \u00a0quote, then go and check all the customs costs.\u00a0Even if it ends up being somewhat more, I&#8217;d still be inclined to\u00a0take it, just to simplify my first purchase.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Subscribe to the Podcast<\/strong> to get the complete 10-part Amazon Startup System delivered to your favourite device!<\/p>\n<p><strong>INSPECTION IN CHINA<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Again we get into this more in <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/8\">Episode #8<\/a>, but it is important to try your best to get independent (3rd party) inspection and testing of your goods in China before they get shipped if you possibly can.<\/p>\n<p>Since one of the keys to quality inspection is the integrity of the inspection person or company, it&#8217;s by far the best to get a recommendation\u00a0via trusted friends or colleagues. This is when being a member of a community of fellow Amazon Sellers is most useful. Also look among your friends with corporate jobs &#8211; you may well find someone who deals with international buying, in which case, they&#8217;re very likely\u00a0to deal with China frequently, since China exports pretty much every type of product in huge quantities. If you&#8217;re using a freight forwarder or Customs Broker (about which more in Episode #8), ask them if they have such contacts &#8211; that&#8217;s how I first found my first inspector in China.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you don&#8217;t yet have such contacts , Alibaba.com has now started offering a service to find you a quality inspection company &#8211; click <a href=\"http:\/\/inspection.alibaba.com\/?tracelog=new_ma_inspection\">here<\/a> to use this service.<\/p>\n<p>I have yet to use these but am considering doing so for a new shipment. I&#8217;ll keep you posted as to how it works.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve paid about $80 a day to an individual.<\/p>\n<p>Bearing in mind that a day was enough to inspect and test 80\/500 units and thus pass Quality Control for 500 units, that&#8217;s a cost of \u00a016 cents or 10 pence per unit for QC &#8211; totally and utterly worth it for a crucial part of the supply chain.<\/p>\n<p>The only company I&#8217;ve foundvia Alibaba.com \u00a0potentially suitable for my next shipment (that covers my type of product and in the right location) , charges $198 USD a day for full inspection.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to have your chosen\u00a0supplier&#8217;s \u00a0factory location to find inspectors of course &#8211; at least, the City and Province.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have products tested in China, then at the very least get them tested in the USA when they land. You will pay a lot more for it and it gives you less control over your supplier.
