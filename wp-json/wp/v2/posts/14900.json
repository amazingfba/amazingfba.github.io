Now, it\u2019s time to dive deeper into the crucial phase of due diligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filtering through potential acquisitions is essential to avoid wasting time and resources. This stage requires a swift yet meticulous approach. Remember, you&#8217;re forming initial impressions and hypotheses. Detailed analysis comes later. For now, focus on identifying promising candidates that align with your goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time Stamp<br><br>[00:58] &#8211; Overview Of Business Buying Process<br>[01:19] &#8211; Importance Of Previous Steps<br>[02:01] &#8211; Defining Financial Criteria<br>[02:39] &#8211; Finding Deals And Deal Flow<br>[03:25] &#8211; Need For Quick And Simple Filtering<br>[04:41] &#8211; Deciding On Meeting Sellers<br>[05:22] &#8211; Filtering Ratios And Mindset<br>[06:15] &#8211; Main Areas For Filtering Businesses<br>[07:04] &#8211; Revenue Considerations<br>[08:24] &#8211; Investment Capacity Alignment<br>[10:25] &#8211; Category And Industry Alignment<br>[11:15] &#8211; Recurring Revenue Importance<br>[12:14] &#8211; Market Fragmentation Analysis<br>[13:39] &#8211; Additional Fit Factors<br>[15:10] &#8211; Simplifying The Filtering Process<br>[16:22] &#8211; Offer For Additional Assistance<br>[17:51] &#8211; Value Of Deal Making Skills<br>[18:10] &#8211; 10k Collective Uber Mastermind Introduction<br>[19:39] &#8211; Three-Year Plan For Seven-Figure Exit<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does the Business Fit Your Buying Criteria?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step in due diligence is assessing whether a business aligns with your predefined criteria. Here are key factors to consider:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Revenue<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A business&#8217;s revenue is a fundamental indicator of its value. Establish a minimum revenue threshold based on your investment capacity. Ensure the business&#8217;s income stream aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Category<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Evaluate if the business operates within an industry you possess expertise in or have a keen interest in. Consider the market&#8217;s overall health, growth potential, and competitive landscape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recurring Revenue<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritize businesses with predictable and consistent income streams. Recurring revenue provides a stable foundation and reduces reliance on one-time sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market Fragmentation<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyze the competitive landscape. A fragmented market often presents opportunities for market leadership and consolidation. Assess the potential for growth and expansion within the niche.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Additional Fit Factors<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the business&#8217;s geographic location and alignment with your target market. Equally important is evaluating the business culture and the seller&#8217;s personality. A good cultural fit can streamline integration and decision-making.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2FE01-what_to_look_for_when_buying_a_business-Step_4A_Filter-auphonic.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2Fdue-diligence-when-buying-a-business-what-to-look-for%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/E01-what_to_look_for_when_buying_a_business-Step_4A_Filter-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=14900-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/E01-what_to_look_for_when_buying_a_business-Step_4A_Filter-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"E01-what_to_look_for_when_buying_a_business-Step_4A_Filter-auphonic.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 20:11 &#8212; 18.5MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 20:11 &#8212; 18.5MB) Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSS In a previous podcast, we outlined the initial steps of finding potential businesses to acquire: deciding on your ideal business, defining your buying criteria, researching revenue potential, and exploring acquisition channels.
