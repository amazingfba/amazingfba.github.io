The end result of all your documents is the crucial COMMERCIAL INVOICE (See below). After that is agreed, your order is, in theory,\u00a0set in stone<\/p>\n<p>Of course in practice, you can look at a so-called &#8220;final&#8221; commercial invoice, realise you or your supplier have made a mistake, and go back to them and get a correction. But it&#8217;s a very good discipline for both you and your supplier to get documents right first time. The Chinese have a strong respect for written documents, so use that to your advantage. It&#8217;s all about 2 things: clarity of what you are both agreeing; and holding your supplier to that agreement.<\/p>\n<p>So do your best\u00a0to do any wiggling, renegotiating and corrections before you\u00a0finally have the Commercial invoice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Definitions and &#8220;final document flow&#8221; (see below for\u00a0actual contents)<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Draft Purchase Order Email &#8211;\u00a0<\/b>this is of course not a technical term! But I put it in as it is a prelude to the Pro Forma Invoice (see below). So you need to be extremely precise in what you ask to be put in the PFI. See below for an exact list of all the info you need to put in the email.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Pro<strong> Forma Invoice (PFI)<\/strong> &#8211; basically a draft Commercial Invoice (see below). As it is a prelude to the CI, check it very carefully.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Purchase Order (PO)\u00a0<\/strong>&#8211; your business&#8217;s formal request to buy goods. This is a very important document so you need to basically do a &#8220;draft PO&#8221; by sending a very detailed email to your supplier (details below), so that you get a good quality PFI back and then your actual PO will be accurate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Commercial Invoice (CI)\u00a0<\/strong>-this is the final document to result from all your back and forth before money gets sent to the Supplier and then goods\u00a0\u00a0are manufactured then sent to you or your warehouse.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><em>It is\u00a0the final and most crucial document.\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_69\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=69\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>The word &#8220;Invoice&#8221; in normal business life implies a straightforward document. Of course accurate invoicing is important, but there are\u00a0not too many consequences if there are errors, as they can be corrected with an apology.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CI can&#8217;t be corrected once it is printed and fixed to all the cartons of your precious products, and it is\u00a0the main document that will get goods through U.S. customs -or cause issues and delays if it is wrong.<\/p>\n<p>So it is a much more crucial document than a normal invoice!<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>My strong advice:\u00a0check and double check every single detail.\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><strong>Then CHECK AGAIN.<\/strong> Trust me on this.

The most important thing each does is: to\u00a0define\u00a0precisely when the responsibility for the shipment passes from the Seller to the Buyer. You can further split that into Risks, Responsibility and Costs but I don&#8217;t believe\u00a0you should overthink this at this stage of knowledge!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logisticsmgepsupv.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/incoterms-1.jpg\">Here&#8217;s a chart\u00a0<\/a>showing the detail if you want to educate yourself.<\/p>\n<p>HOWEVER &#8211; The good news is that there are only 4 incoterms you&#8217;ll probably need to discuss or understand as long as you are using air freight (and I do NOT recommend using sea freight for a first order):<\/p>\n<p><strong>EXW<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; &#8220;Ex Works&#8221; &#8211; this is the price straight from the Factory Gates. I would never advise you buying on these terms because it means you would have to engage a Freight Forwarder to get the product through all the hoops (clear Chinese customs, get put on board plane, get freight plane over to USA, clear USA customs, etc. etc). It is useful sometimes at the sourcing stage for\u00a0\u00a0a like-for-like comparison for price between different suppliers. But don&#8217;t agree to it at this final stage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FOB &#8211; &#8220;Free on Board&#8221; &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>The Seller will pay for Land transport to the port, export customs, and loading on board the ship.\u00a0This technically can only be used with Sea Freight but the Chinese use it all the time for sea\u00a0or air freight.<\/p>\n<p>Again, this is a very common way of quoting price so useful at sourcing stage. At this stage of ordering, I think you should avoid like the plague. I think this leaves way too much for you to organise (international freight, clearing US customs, unloading in US Port, \u00a0organising freight within the USA to your warehouse etc.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>DAP &#8211; &#8220;Delivered At Place&#8221;\u00a0<\/strong>&#8211; sometimes (incorrectly) called &#8220;DDU&#8221; &#8211; Delivered Duty Unpaid (I am guilty of using this term too, possibly influenced by one of my suppliers!).<\/p>\n<p>This means the supplier undertakes to do everything necessary to deliver your products from their factory door directly to your warehouse, EXCEPT for clearing U.S. customs and paying U.S. import duty.<\/p>\n<p>This is the method I have used so far with both\u00a0of my current suppliers and all my imports (6 to date). I like it because it takes care of most of the issues, but it still can leave you holding the baby with the U.S. customs. It is my recommended method unless you can get DDP (see below), which is even\u00a0more straightforward for you.<\/p>\n<p>If you use this method, you will almost certainly get a better freight rate than if you asked for it yourself. That&#8217;s because your supplier ships probably 100X more volume per month than you are importing. However, you can check this price is reasonable by opening an account yourself with DHL (or Fedex or UPS or whoever they use for freight), and getting a quote for air freight to your warehouse address.<\/p>\n<p>You need to open an account with DHL (or Fedex or UPS) anyway so you have a way for them to easily invoice you for customs duty etc., so you might as well get a quote while you do that.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to know the exact weight and dimensions of each (packaged) unit, or the weight and dimensions of each carton=case of products (and of course the number of units per carton). Then you can calculate the cost per unit and the total cost.<\/p>\n<p>For reference, I&#8217;ve generally been charged about 7-8 USD per kilo for air Freight DAP to Portland, Oregon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DHL\/Fedex or UPS only, folks!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really important if you use this method to only work with a supplier who will work with one of the standard courier companies: DHL, Fedex or UPS. That&#8217;s because of customs clearance in the USA. If you set up your own (company&#8217;s) account with DHL, they can pay for duty and customs charges upfront and will invoice you or charge you directly for it. This means you don&#8217;t need a customs broker to clear U.S. customs.<\/p>\n<p>If you allow your supplier to use any courier company that uses a normal airline, you will \u00a0need to use a customs broker, meaning more costs and more complications for you. SPELL OUT to them that they are not to do this! Guess how I learnt about this!<\/p>\n<p><strong>DDP- &#8220;Delivered Duty Paid&#8221; &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>This is the De luxe and simplest of all Freight terms &#8211; your supplier will pay for and be responsible for everything from their factory gates up to your warehouse gates, including Customs duty and any customs clearance costs.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t yet found a supplier who is willing to supply on this basis, as it means they are exposed to the vagaries of U.S. Customs. BUT \u00a0if you can find one, I totally recommend this unless the price is outrageous.<\/p>\n<p>It means that you effectively don&#8217;t have to think about the Freight part of your supply chain and avoid any potential complications with the U.S. Customs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>U.S. CUSTOMS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is possibly\u00a0the most worrying\/stressful single area of importing, but if you get your paperwork spot on, you should have few problems with it. I&#8217;ve only had problems so far when the supplier didn&#8217;t use a standard courier as discussed already.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Duty Calculator\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dutycalculator.com\/new-import-duty-and-tax-calculation\/\">www.dutycalculator.com<\/a>\u00a0As the name implies, you can calculate the import duty %age that any product attracts. Just follow the simple prompts &#8211; which country importing from? which to? Product description? etc.<\/p>\n<p>Duty rates vary from 0% to 37% but I&#8217;ve only found between 0% and 6.5% for my products so far. Only 3 credits for free so use only when you&#8217;ve shortlisted to 3 product types in product research. Then use again at this stage to double check your costs for your Profit &amp; Loss calculations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WORKING WITH YOUR WAREHOUSE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is something I&#8217;ll go into in more detail in the next episode, along with Amazon Inbound Shipping. But I&#8217;m including both here to complete the end of your Supply Chain.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve got products to Amazon, you&#8217;ve completed\u00a0the end of your Sourcing Phase of the Startup process.<\/p>\n<p>If your warehouse is experienced and competent, Like ECM or FBAI, it should not be a big deal for them to work sensibly with you. After all, for the first time in a while, you&#8217;re dealing with native English speakers (for the most part, anyway!). Huzzah! Also, most places are experienced with Amazon&#8217;s requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Again, just be crystal clear<\/p>\n<p>a. that you know what services they can offer.<\/p>\n<p>b. that YOU know which ones you want<\/p>\n<p>c. that you communicate to the WAREHOUSE exactly what you want.<\/p>\n<p>Services receiving warehouses generally offer include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>receiving goods (this is the most basic service for which you are using them)<\/li>\n<li>sticking on Amazon FNSKU labels (Amazon can do this for you at 20 cents each, which is similar to what other places charge, but check)<\/li>\n<li>putting in inserts, e.g., &#8220;Go to this website to activate your warranty&#8221; &#8211; which I use to capture email addresses within Amazon&#8217;s Terms of Service (TOS)<\/li>\n<li>testing products if you haven&#8217;t had that done in China (in which case you need to create and send crystal clear instructions &#8211; see <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/8-0\/\">episode #8<\/a> for details)<\/li>\n<li>inspecting products and product inner packaging \u00a0 superficially<\/li>\n<li>replacing damaged inner boxes \u00a0**TIP** get your supplier to create about 10-20% extra inner boxes to replace any damaged in transit. So for 500 units, you want 50-100 extra boxes. Amazon will count damaged inner boxes as defective units<\/li>\n<li>repackaging\u00a0inner boxes (units) into outer boxes=cartons=cases ready to ship<\/li>\n<li>liaising with UPS (Amazon&#8217;s dedicated courier for inbound shipping)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Try to agree it all upfront. That&#8217;s better for (i) budget planning and (ii) smooth working &amp; quicker timescales with your warehouse. However, stay in touch with them and if you need extra services last minute, they are normally happy to do those. Just expect a small extra delay if you do this. First time out especially, you&#8217;re likely to need to tweak things. Don&#8217;t give yourself a hard time- just keep moving!<\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_69\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=69\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p><strong>INBOUND SHIPPING TO AMAZON<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll cover this in more detail in the next episode, but you need to know about this at this stage.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to have set up a product listing at this stage.
