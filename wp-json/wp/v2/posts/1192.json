There are different parts to the Amazon supply chain and psychology plays a major role in many of these. The aspects that I am most fluent in are negotiations and selling\/marketing. What makes consumers buy and what makes consumers attracted to your projects?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently we talked about <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/124-how-triple-m-principle-can-transform-your-ecommerce-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">message to market match<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and that if someone is looking to buy a red dog bowl and you are specifically selling a red dog bowl then they are much more likely to buy your product. This is a very powerful concept. This can be the basis for an incredible business. The other thing we talked about was <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/125-klt-can-win-you-customers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know, Like, and Trust.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeing this from the Buyer\u2019s Perspective<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other day, I was going to print some music from my Brother printer and I was getting an error telling me to change my toner. I didn\u2019t want to deal with this but I knew I had to take care of it and not be lazy. Notice, I\u2019m reacting to a problem. I\u2019m not thinking this through like a business transaction. It\u2019s a consumer purchase, I\u2019m not a print shop, I\u2019m just a musician that occasionally prints some stuff. I didn\u2019t plan it, I didn\u2019t know about it and I didn\u2019t want to do it but it\u2019s a necessity. I was motivated by urgency. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urgency as a Driving Force<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s often the case with consumers on Amazon with all types a products. From things as mundane as a printer cartridge or as urgent as forgetting to get a birthday gift for your spouse. If I had more time I would go down to the shop and buy the cartridge or item I needed. However, I just so busy, I need to buy it quickly on Amazon and get on with my day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my urgency and need to be done with this quickly, I almost missed the mental processes that took place. So, I get on Amazon, search for the printer cartridge I need and scroll through the listings. I got to about the fourth one down and immediately decided that\u2019s the one I want, almost missing what was going on in my head.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Value of Bundling<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first listing was \u00a39 and it looked like a compatible item, but I scrolled past it until the fourth or fifth which really caught my attention. It was such an intuitive process that I had to slow it down and ask myself, \u201cwhy am I about to but this?\u201d First off, I\u2019m not in a price comparing mood. It was way cheaper than I was expecting. I was expecting \u00a340 or \u00a350 for an actual Brother cartridge and the listings were in the \u00a39 to \u00a315 range. My price resistance was way down because I was prepared to pay almost 5 times that amount and move on. Since it was so much cheaper, I wasn\u2019t going to sit there and compare prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What set the listings apart, and what won it for me, was the one offered a two-pack. If I were to reverse engineer my buying thought process, the first thing that got me was that it was a two-pack and bundling brings out the value thinking. The price compared to the top listing. I could see that it was a value to get the two-pack over the one pack. The my frustration of running out. Since I didn\u2019t want to be in this situation, I would want to buy the two-pack so I wouldn\u2019t have to go through this. This is true for a lot of stuff. If you are selling anything renewable, bundling them brings value to the buyer because they don\u2019t want to run out in a month or two.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Value of Message to Market Match<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next thing thing that won me over was that it specifically said it was for a Brother printer. The listing said exactly what I wanting to see rather than almost what I wanted to see. That helped push me over the edge and buy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychology of Sales<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even as an Amazon seller, I was almost taken unaware with the way selling works. If I didn\u2019t spend my life working on Amazon and teaching others how to sell on Amazon, I would have completely missed how the psychology of this process works. It came down to three things.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The price, relative to the other listings<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bundling value<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exact match of what I was looking for<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last thing I noticed that influenced my decision want the ratings. The top listing had 39 reviews and 4.5 stars. It was that little bit of imperfection. Whereas the one I bought had 16 reviews and a 5 star average. If I were being objective, I would calculate it. The one listing had many more reviews and likely had just as good overall satisfaction. Some buyers will do this, so it is a very important aspect to be aware of. However, in these urgent situations, consumers tend to be irrational and see 4.5 stars compared to 5.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch What Really Makes Ama\u00adzon Shoppers Buy<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ek42caNQxqY&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F126.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2Freally-makes-amazon-shoppers-buy%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/126.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=1192-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/126.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"126.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 9:36 &#8212; 8.1MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 9:36 &#8212; 8.1MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSI wasn\u2019t planning on recording any podcast for a few days but I just had an experience as an Amazon buyer that is very important for Amazon sellers to understand.
