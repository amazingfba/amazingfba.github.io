While it may seem that using standard sizes and styles is more cost-effective, if the boxes are not a perfect fit for their contents, there&#8217;s a high possibility that the contents won&#8217;t be as protected as they need to be. This could lead to the use of excessive protection materials and higher shipping charges, among other issues. This post will delve into all these potential issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been considering freighting your small business in custom shipping boxes, here are some of the many benefits of making the swap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Increased Protection<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jetbox.melbourne\/custom-boxes-and-packaging\"> custom boxes<\/a> are more likely to offer more support and protection for your products as the boxes are specifically designed to fit the contents and not vice versa. This means there will be less room for products to move around, and they&#8217;re held securely internally for the duration of the shipping process. You can add your inserts to protect different products or materials, i.e., glass, within the custom-fit shipping boxes; however, a box that is designed exactly for what it is shipping will offer more protection, providing a sense of security for your products and your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cost Effective<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the right-sized packaging can offer you reduced costs in a few ways. You can save on the cost of the box itself as you&#8217;re not paying for excessive packaging for your shipping needs. On top of this, you can save on the amount of filling you need to add to the boxes to offer increased protection and support during shipping. Lastly, you can reduce the cost of your shipping as larger boxes will incur higher charges, which can waste your money if they aren&#8217;t full.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Increased Marketing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/benefits-using-custom-boxes-packaging-your-product-apbltd\">use your custom shipping boxes to help boost your marketing efforts<\/a>? By designing carefully crafted boxes for your deliveries using your branding or other designs, you can increase the likelihood the customer will want to share the package on social media.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can, in turn, form part of your marketing plan as the customer is giving you free advertising via their social media channels even if you don&#8217;t use it directly or they only share it with family and friends. User-generated content is a huge tool for small businesses, and your packaging can be instrumental in swaying customers to share their orders with others publicly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Increased Customer Satisfaction<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesbusinesscouncil\/2022\/12\/12\/customer-retention-versus-customer-acquisition\/\">Forbes magazine, around 80% of customers do not make repeat purchases as the company&#8217;s packaging is poor<\/a>. Custom shipping boxes can assist you in achieving customer satisfaction and remove the risk of them only being a one-time customer solely due to your packaging options. With so many other businesses to choose from and e-commerce being an absolute juggernaut in terms of retail options, losing loyal customers and new ones due to your packaging shouldn&#8217;t be an option. Investing in custom boxes that are visually appealing and protect the shipments you make can help you increase customer satisfaction and encourage repeat customers, too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Investing in custom shipping boxes can bring numerous benefits to your business.
