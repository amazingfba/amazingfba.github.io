Do. Review.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to practice what I preach and look back over the past year, and past several years. When you review, it\u2019s a prelude to changing your action to get a different future.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>One of the things in the future of Amazing FBA is a new podcast, 10K Collective. Examples of some topics include preparing your business to sell, how to get some massive loans to boost sales, and how to get money back from Amazon in refunds. This podcast is ideal for those who already have revenue and more advanced sellers.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s tempting in a review to just give a list of numbers. However, I think it is important to pull them together into a picture. The numbers tell a story.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Right-brain\/whole picture<\/strong><\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>How are you feeling about your Amazon business?<\/li>\n<li>What skills have you learned that is not immediately going to show in KPIs?<br \/>\nIt can often take several years for skills to show changes in personal income.<\/li>\n<li>What mindset shifts can you identify?<br \/>\nA mindset shift I have seen in my own business is that I don\u2019t rely on research as much. I get something out there and try to sell it to see if a market is any good.<\/li>\n<li>Where are you going with this business? Are you on track?<\/li>\n<li>What high-level things do you need to track?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1><strong>Basic Key Performance Indicators (KPI)<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p><strong>Principles <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always \u201cclose the loop\u201d \u2013to improve FUTURE action, review the effects of PAST actions<br \/>\nThe classic time to do this is to look through your profit and loss reports in January for the previous year. This will give you a good indication of how profitable you were and will help you adjust to make sure there is profit there.<\/li>\n<li>Always know your financial numbers or you\u2019re driving utterly blind.<br \/>\nYou need to know things like the break-even point for products, if a product is profitable at a certain price, for example.<\/li>\n<li>Know your product-based KPIs (sessions &amp; conversions).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>People are often ignorant of this, however, it is very easy to find out.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Measure your Keyword &amp; Ad-data. Ads cost a lot \u2013 you MUST measure if you\u2019re getting a result.<br \/>\nWithin the retail business, ads make the most money. It is the largest source of revenue for Amazon, so it is important to keep track of how much you are spending on it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Seller Central Dashboard<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re doing FBM=Fulfilled by Merchant <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How is FBM measuring up to FBA?\n<ul>\n<li>Orders<\/li>\n<li>Keyword ranking<\/li>\n<li>Conversion rates<\/li>\n<li>Profit?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Business Reports<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Main report: <strong>By ASIN<\/strong>&gt; Detail Page Sales and Traffic by Parent Item<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sessions (visits)<\/li>\n<li>unit session percentage (Conversion rate)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Download your data monthly <\/strong>(Full data disappears after 18 months)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Amazon Ads (Onscreen data)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How well is your product converting?\n<ul>\n<li>Could you experiment with pictures, price, text to improve this?<\/li>\n<li>How does it compare to last year?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Amazon Ads data<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Check on screen <\/strong>(Advertising &gt; All Campaigns) BEFORE using Search Term Report \u2013 it\u2019s a lot easier!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check which campaigns have resulted in significant spend; and which in meaningful sales<\/li>\n<li>Check each Manual Campaign:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>o Dig till you get \u201cTargeting\u201d = keywords you\u2019re targeting o Adjust \u201cColumns\u201d so you see all of the data o <strong>For each keyword with significant traffic<\/strong>, check the following data points:<\/p>\n<p>\u25aa <strong>Impressions <\/strong>\u2013 (how many times an ad was <em>shown<\/em>) &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>\u25aa <strong>Clicks <\/strong>\u2013 what ads actually got shoppers to <em>visit <\/em>your listing?<\/p>\n<p>\u25aa <strong>Click-Through Rate (CTR)<\/strong>-(clicks\u00f7impressions) &#8211; look out for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>clicks under 0.7% (irrelevant, reduce bid);<\/li>\n<li>or over 0.7% (relevant, will help keyword ranking; raise bid per click)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u25aa <strong>Orders <\/strong>\u2013 is this keyword driving <em>sales<\/em>?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there opportunities for keywords with good search volume?
