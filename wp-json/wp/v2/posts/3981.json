This episode we want to focus on using social media to check where the market is at on a product.<\/p>\n<h2>How Social Media fit in with Amazon Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll find that there are big players in the retail space that haven\u2019t gone to Amazon yet. They\u2019re doing well in traditional retail outlets and see Amazon as a small market. If they ever decide to sell on Amazon, they would dominate over you. You can find these companies by doing a simple Google search of some of the keywords for your product. <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/azanalyzer\">AZAnalyser<\/a> has of tool that does it for you as well as many more features, but a simple Google search will likely turn up what you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>If you find that the product has a following on Facebook, you can determine quite a bit about it. If the posts for the product get a lot of likes but people aren\u2019t talking about it, then it\u2019s not really an engaging audience. That may be too generic and the problem you\u2019re trying to solve has already been done. You want to look for an engaged audience that wants to talk about the product and share it.<\/p>\n<h2>Use AZSocializer to Help your Social Media Strategy<\/h2>\n<p>AZSocializer is similar to MeetEdgar or similar software that posts to your social media accounts. Once you get a product launched you\u2019ll want to promote it on social media platforms. It\u2019s a great tool to get your brand in front of people.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, it\u2019s very valuable to look at the data. That way you can see what people are saying about you and what the market is like for the product. If you can find RSS feeds relating to the market, then you can get a steady stream of data about it. They can also find Facebook groups\u00a0with people who they think would be buyers and post content that might add value to the group.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Social Media once you have a Product<\/h2>\n<p>Most of that is done before you even speak to the manufacturers. It\u2019s important to lay the groundwork and get as much data as you can before you launch. Once you have a product to sell, the first thing you need to go is set up a one-page website. The point of the site isn\u2019t to sell, it to use marketing tools. You will use the site as a pass-through for people. You\u2019ll have the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/tag-manager\/\">Google Tag<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/651294705016616\">Facebook Pixel<\/a> so you can tag potential buyers so you can market to them later.<\/p>\n<h2>Email Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Because you\u2019ve laid the groundwork before you launched, you have some credibility on social media. You don\u2019t want to constantly sell; your goal should be to add value. So, drop links to interesting articles and such. Then you can offer a discount in exchange for an email address. Once you have that, you have amazing access. Again, don\u2019t sell right off the bat and don\u2019t send them too much. Once a month or so you should be in heir inbox offering value.<\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_201\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=201\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Social Media for Amazon Market Research with Reed Menssa Part 2 of 3<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VDSKm_mwRsA&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F228.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F228-social-media-amazon-market-research%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/228.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=3981-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/228.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"228.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 19:45 &#8212; 16.2MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 19:45 &#8212; 16.2MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSWe have Reed Menssa back on the show today to talk about social media research and off-Amazon marketing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3977,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","enabled":false}}},"categories":[4],"tags":[1853,484,913,485,572,204,201,140,587,916,914],"class_list":["post-3981","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-amazon-fba","tag-amazing-fba-podcast","tag-amazon","tag-chinese-manufacturers","tag-fba","tag-manufacturing","tag-market-research","tag-private-label","tag-product-research","tag-social-media","tag-social-media-marketing","tag-social-proof","post-wrapper","thrv_wrapper"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Social Media for Amazon Sellers with Reed Menssa<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"We have Reed Menssa back on the show today to talk about social media research and off-Amazon marketing.
