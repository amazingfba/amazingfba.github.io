He bootstrapped a web development company from a shoestring budget into a multi-million dollar powerhouse, generating over $5 million in profit. One of his biggest success factors? Building a high-performing team in the Philippines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guide delves into Kody&#8217;s journey, exploring how he leveraged Filipino talent to achieve explosive growth. We&#8217;ll uncover his recruitment strategies, team management philosophies, and the key benefits of outsourcing for ecommerce businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Stamp<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00] &#8211; Introduction To The Podcast And Host Michael Veazey<br>[01:09] &#8211; Welcome To The 10K Collective Podcast<br>[01:26] &#8211; Introduction Of Guest Cody Thompson From WorkPod<br>[02:02] &#8211; Early Stages Of Building A Remote Team<br>[03:29] &#8211; Mental Leap To Get Started With Outsourcing<br>[03:48] &#8211; Using Freelance Platforms And Virtual Staff Finder<br>[05:03] &#8211; Setting Up A Physical Office In Dumaguete Philippines<br>[05:50] &#8211; Renting Space From Silliman University<br>[07:17] &#8211; Creating An Internship Program With University Students<br>[08:57] &#8211; Navigating The Challenges Of Internship Programs<br>[10:16] &#8211; Building Relationships With University Deans<br>[11:56] &#8211; Streamlining The Hiring Process Through Internships<br>[13:03] &#8211; Importance Of Local Relationships In Recruitment<br>[14:29] &#8211; Introduction To WorkPod And Its Services<br>[15:50] &#8211; Providing Support And Frameworks For Managing Remote Teams<br>[17:03] &#8211; Common Management Mistakes With Remote Staff<br>[18:58] &#8211; Learning From Management Mistakes And Experiences<br>[20:24] &#8211; Challenges In Positioning Talented Employees<br>[22:12] &#8211; Introduction Of VA Task Outsourcing Checklist<br>[24:01] &#8211; Closing Remarks And Invitation To Join 10K Collective Mastermind<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From Freelance Hustle to Global Success: The Power of Outsourcing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kody&#8217;s story begins like many others \u2013 a freelance graphic designer trading time for money. But Kody recognized the limitations of this approach. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t getting paid when I was doing bookkeeping or social media,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;My value lies in design.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This realization sparked a pivotal shift. Kody started outsourcing administrative tasks, freeing him to focus on his core skills. This newfound efficiency fueled the growth of his web development company, propelling his annual revenue to a staggering $700,000 with a team of just 5-6 Filipino virtual assistants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building a Dream Team: Beyond Remote Work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While outsourcing tasks proved beneficial, Kody realized the limitations of a fully remote team. Managing talent spread across different locations posed challenges. The solution? Building a centralized team in the Philippines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But where to start? Kody identified Dumaguete City, home to top universities brimming with tech talent. He secured office space near the university, forging partnerships with deans and establishing an internship program. This provided direct access to top students, many of whom transitioned into full-time positions after graduation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding the Right Talent: Avoiding Common Mistakes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Outsourcing success hinges on finding and retaining skilled personnel. Kody highlights some of the most common pitfalls:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Assuming everyone learns like you:<\/strong> Different people learn in different ways. Tailor your training methods to ensure effective skills transfer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adaptability:<\/strong> Resistance to change is a common obstacle. Foster a culture that embraces evolution and continuous improvement.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unreliable Payment:<\/strong> Not paying staff on time is a recipe for disaster. Develop a robust payroll system and prioritize on-time salary payments.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Inadequate Training:<\/strong> Throwing new hires into the deep end without proper training sets them up for failure. Invest in comprehensive training processes and establish clear procedures.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WrkPod: Beyond Recruitment, Building a Thriving Ecosystem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kody&#8217;s passion extends beyond simply connecting businesses with Filipino talent. WrkPod offers a comprehensive ecosystem to empower entrepreneurs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Recruitment:<\/strong> Assistance in finding the perfect fit for your team, including salary negotiation and recruitment fees.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Staff Management:<\/strong> Benefit from WrkPod&#8217;s infrastructure, including IT support, dedicated workspaces, and training rooms.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Client Support:<\/strong> Access to templates, frameworks, and HR policies to streamline your operations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scaling Your Dream: The Filipino Advantage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a successful ecommerce business requires a strategic approach. Here are some key takeaways from Kody&#8217;s experience:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cost Efficiency:<\/strong> Filipino talent offers competitive rates, allowing you to stretch your budget further.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Skill &amp; Expertise:<\/strong> The Philippines boasts a growing pool of highly skilled individuals with a strong work ethic.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cultural Alignment:<\/strong> Filipinos are renowned for their positive attitude and dedication, making for a collaborative and productive team environment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ready to Scale with Filipino Talent?
