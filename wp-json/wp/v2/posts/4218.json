At <a href=\"https:\/\/systemscultureimpact.com\/\">Systems, Culture &amp; Impact<\/a>, Aaron teaches his readers and clients the secrets to delegation and outsourcing efficiently so they can handle the workload of their Amazon business.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Systems Will Set You Free!<\/h2>\n<h3>How Aaron Got His Start<\/h3>\n<p>Since 2013 Aaron has sold many millions of dollars worth of product across the Amazon marketplaces. He&#8217;s been involved in building some fairly large teams in the Philippines to handle many different private label products across many different brands. It&#8217;s been his role to figure out all of the systems and process within the team. \u00a0Through that process of trial and error, he&#8217;s been able to learn quite a few things along the way. Today, he&#8217;s here to share some of those things he&#8217;s learned on his journey so far.<\/p>\n<h2>Reaching Your Capacity<\/h2>\n<p>Eventually, there will come a time when you, as a business owner, \u00a0will hit your capacity. You&#8217;re fighting fires all day; you&#8217;re the bottleneck. You are working every day on low-value tasks like customer service, inventory management, bookkeeping, etc. Businesses have failed because of this. Offloading tasks and creating systems can be crucial to the growth of your business.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve reached your capacity, you&#8217;ll see the signs of the problem seeping out into your life. For some, it&#8217;s missed dinners with the family. For Aaron, it was a broken promise to his daughter. He let his business take up so much of his time that it hurt his family. That&#8217;s when Aaron decided it was time for help.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/paper-3309829_640.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"4224\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/243-outsourcing-aaron-osullivan\/paper-3309829_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/paper-3309829_640.jpg?fit=640%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,486\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"paper-3309829_640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/paper-3309829_640.jpg?fit=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/paper-3309829_640.jpg?fit=640%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4224 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/paper-3309829_640-300x228.jpg?resize=300%2C228\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/paper-3309829_640.jpg?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/paper-3309829_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a>How to Quickly Offload Tasks<\/h2>\n<p>The first mistake many people make when they&#8217;re looking to hire a virtual assistant is failing to build a list of tasks ahead of time. If you don&#8217;t know what jobs need doing, you&#8217;ll never be able to teach someone else what to do or how to do it. It&#8217;s imperative that you have a transparent onboarding process for your new virtual assistant.<\/p>\n<h2>Download, Track &amp; Rank Your Tasks<\/h2>\n<h3>Download<\/h3>\n<p>Take a look back over the past few weeks and months. Collect all the tasks you&#8217;ve done. Plug these tasks into a google sheet so you can keep track of them. Build a list of all the tasks you do on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis.<\/p>\n<h3>Track<\/h3>\n<p>This will change your life. For 3-5 days, keep track every time you switch tasks. Context switching costs a lot of brain power and focus. You&#8217;ll be astonished by how much time is wasted just moving from task to task in your daily workflow.<\/p>\n<h3>Rank<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve compiled a list of all the things you do to run your business, it&#8217;s time to rank them. At the top of the list go the time consumers; the little things you wish you could get off of your plate that stand in the way of doing the high-value jobs that will move your business forward regarding productivity and growth.<\/p>\n<p>Now draw a line somewhere between the 10th and 15th task on that list. This is your strike list. You can hand it to your virtual assistant as an outline of what they&#8217;ll need to do to help you open up your schedule to do the things that matter.<\/p>\n<h3>Record Videos<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.useloom.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UseLoom.com<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/snagit.en.softonic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SnagIt<\/a> are a couple of great tools to help you build a portfolio or training videos that you&#8217;ll use to teach the help you hire how to serve you and your company better. \u00a0Loom is an easy and free screen recorder for Chrome.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re going to be doing these tasks anyway so why not hit record and never have to do them again?!<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s use the example of checking and responding to Amazon customer service emails. Before you hit record, it&#8217;s crucial to map out the steps. After a while, you may not need to do this, but when you&#8217;re getting started, it&#8217;s essential to maintaining a good workflow. \u00a0Once you&#8217;ve mapped out the steps, hit record. When you start the video give some context.<\/p>\n<h2>Make sure you include:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Outcome<\/li>\n<li>The Purpose<\/li>\n<li>When it Happens<\/li>\n<li>What Success Looks Like<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now show them how to do the task. Hit stop and now you&#8217;ve got a video you can point somebody to when you&#8217;re ready to hire an assistant.<\/p>\n<h2>Have Your Virtual Assistant Write a Standard Operating Procedure<\/h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve hired somebody, have them watch the video and create a Standard Operating Procedure. It will help them learn the task, and also give direction to any assistants you may need to hire in the future. Having a filing cabinet of these S.O.P.s will also make your business more valuable to any potential buyer for your business in the future. If someone can open up a filing cabinet full of S.O.P.s and learn how to do any task required to run your company, they&#8217;ll feel much more security that they can grow the business and get great R.O.I.<\/p>\n<h2>Set Tasks to Repeat<\/h2>\n<p>Use a project management tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trello<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/asana.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asana<\/a> to set the tasks to repeat in their calendar. This way you won&#8217;t be spoon feeding your virtual assistant tasks.<\/p>\n<h2>Finally, store the S.O.P. and celebrate.<\/h2>\n<p>Positive reinforcement is important. When your virtual assistant has completed the S.O.P. and in turn the task, celebrate! File the S.O.P. and do something to show your virtual assistant they&#8217;ve done an excellent job.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re struggling to find a virtual assistant, there are a number of online platforms that can help. <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/freeeup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FreeeUp<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onlinejobs.ph\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OnlineJobs.ph<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UpWork<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/priorityva.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Priority VA<\/a> just to name a few. You can always feel free to contact Aaron for any help you need finding a virtual assistant as well.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Scale Up From Virtual Assistant Novice to Ninja in 8 Weeks<\/h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve hired your virtual assistant, you&#8217;ll want to ramp up their responsibility over the course of eight weeks. Each week you&#8217;ll hand your virtual assistant two tasks. Explain how your business works and make them feel like they&#8217;re a part of it. People are secretly dying to be led. Show them how to add value to your business, and they&#8217;ll be eager to do so.<\/p>\n<h3>Week 1: Connection<\/h3>\n<p>Make the first task something simple that needs to be done regularly. Show your virtual assistant how your company works; try to indoctrinate them into your way of doing business. Build a rapport. Share the purpose, values, and vision of your company.<\/p>\n<h3>Week 2: Clarity<\/h3>\n<p>Set your virtual assistant straight on your priorities. They&#8217;ll need to know what&#8217;s expected of them and what your goals are as a company.<\/p>\n<h3>Week 3: Routines<\/h3>\n<p>Get your virtual assistant in sync with your team. Establish daily meetings and one-on-ones. Get them familiar with what needs to happen when and get them into the rhythm of your daily processes.<\/p>\n<h3>Week 4: Ramp Up<\/h3>\n<p>Decide, based on their performance, what kind of tasks you&#8217;re going to give your virtual assistant can handle regarding responsibility. This is about taking stock of where they currently are, understanding how far they&#8217;ve come, and determining which tasks they can handle.<\/p>\n<h3>Week 5: Leverage<\/h3>\n<p>Create training for higher responsibility tasks. If you&#8217;re spending 10 hours a week on a task, and you can offload 7 hours of that time spent on the plate of your virtual assistant. That time can then be used for high-value functions that will help you grow your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Week 6: Liftoff<\/h3>\n<p>Focus on those high-value areas of your business. Make sure for every hour taken off your plate in Week 5 there&#8217;s a high-value function you&#8217;re handling instead.<\/p>\n<h3>Week 7: Recalibrate<\/h3>\n<p>Check-in. If you&#8217;re employing your virtual assistant for 40 hours a week, but they&#8217;re only taking 30 to complete the tasks you&#8217;ve given them, you&#8217;ve got ten more hours you can hand over to them. Take stock of their capacity and adjust accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>Week 8: Review<\/h3>\n<p>Get feedback from your virtual assistant. Learn what could be improved. Review their progress, see what they can handle, and celebrate the eight-week journey you&#8217;ve just come through. Your framework doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect. Follow the steps and improve as you go and you&#8217;ll be well on your way to making more money with your Amazon business.<\/p>\n<h2>Action Steps!<\/h2>\n<p>Action 1: Download the Blueprint at <a href=\"http:\/\/AmazingFBA.com\/System\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AmazingFBA.com\/System<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Action 2: Block Off Time to Download, Track and Rank Your Tasks<\/p>\n<p>Action 3: Record Videos.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Aaron O&#8217;Sullivan visit his website <a href=\"https:\/\/systemscultureimpact.com\/download\">SystemsCultureImpact.com<\/a> and tune in next time for another session of Q&amp;A.<\/p>\n<p>See the previous interviews we&#8217;ve had with Aaron at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/aaron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/aaron<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Outsourcing with Aaron O&#8217;Sullivan from System Cultures Impact Part 1 of 2<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h6mED81mJxg&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F243.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F243-outsourcing-aaron-osullivan%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/243.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=4218-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/243.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"243.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 34:27 &#8212; 28.0MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 34:27 &#8212; 28.0MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSAaron O\u2019Sullivan is an expert in outsourcing.
