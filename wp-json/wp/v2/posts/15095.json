However, just because it might seem like quite a simple thing to do as long as you\u2019ve got a website and some social media happening, the truth is that there\u2019s just as much to think about (and maybe more) as if you had a brick and mortar store, and it\u2019s easy to make mistakes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that whereas in real life mistakes can often be rectified without too much damage done, when it comes to your eCommerce business, that might not be the case, and one mistake could spell disaster. With that in mind, here are some common eCommerce mistakes and how to avoid them &#8211; read on to find out more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXd-h4XWyc30qqUVMqasdkxpicUWIoTaj4K5wIqwYptJuFBi2KTw4LQKrk_so82LTMVbLxG-L9Nyjn79EcnU1dqyRIeQALoHBDDcrJKDObTdUDd0Tr0MYgXZoZWmiHCGbsmA9unF?key=-6WDhlMEUAiiAlilBh9tF3Qw\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ignoring Mobile Optimization<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s 2024, and most people shop on their phones, not on a computer (or at least they\u2019ll browse on their phones and then make the final purchase on their computer), and if your website isn\u2019t mobile-friendly, you\u2019re essentially losing customers before they even get to the checkout page. Tiny text, slow loading times, challenging (to put it politely) navigation\u2026 it all causes frustration that could send your potential customers directly to your competitors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why you need to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2011\/01\/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design\/\">responsive design<\/a> to make sure your website works properly on any device, whatever the size of the screen. It\u2019s wise to test your website on a range of screen sizes from time to time to ensure it\u2019s doing what it\u2019s meant to do and so you can keep on top of things, just in case.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making The Checkout Process Complicated<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if your site is great and a customer has chosen what they wanted and is ready to pay, you can still lose them right at the last second if you\u2019ve got a complicated checkout experience &#8211; that could include things like too many steps, making them create an account, limited payment options, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fix is to simplify the checkout process as much as possible, so let people check out as guests if they want to, and always make sure you offer plenty of payment options so everyone is happy. And it has to be secure as well otherwise you\u2019ll lose trust and that\u2019s never a good thing. It\u2019s a good idea to learn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.north.com\/blog\/credit-card-processing-the-ultimate-guide-for-merchants\">all about payment processing<\/a> because the more you know, the better the checkout experience will be for your customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Skipping Product Descriptions&nbsp;<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever landed on a product page and it\u2019s just a photo and a price? If so, you\u2019ll know that\u2019s not enough &#8211; as a customer, you want more than that, especially if the price is a high one (but it\u2019s the same principle for all products). After all, how are you going to know that what you\u2019re buying is the right thing or worth the money if there\u2019s no information? Customers will either just decide not to bother or they\u2019ll go to another site to learn more, and probably end up buying there instead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why you need to write clear, engaging, accurate, and detailed product descriptions &#8211; make sure you highlight key features, talk about benefits, and mention any specific unique selling points &#8211; and if you can include a video showing how it works, that\u2019s even better.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Running an eCommerce business can be a fantastic option these days &#8211; it\u2019s what customers want, and it comes with plenty of benefits.
