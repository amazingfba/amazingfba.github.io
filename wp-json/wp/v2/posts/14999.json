The main thing for today is this look at this panel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a bunch of different options, look how many options, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 different options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess which one I always use? Eco. Why? Because I want it simple. I&#8217;ve got four options for how dry I want it. The one is hanger dry and the previous one is like, extra dry. And then the other one is iron it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would argue that you probably need three settings maximum there. Then you&#8217;ve got everything else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timing, how long it lasts for I don&#8217;t even know what that does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the temperature obviously, that&#8217;s something special. Guess what I do? I use Eco, I choose the driest one, I press on and then I&#8217;m done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>if you overcomplicate the user interface of any product at all, you are probably not adding value for anyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you probably think you are adding value because engineers love complexity and they love solving problems. And so the product designers, as you get very, very deep into a product there, you realize there are more and more nuances. And you think you&#8217;re adding value by adding complication. I very much doubt you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that you&#8217;re very likely to be adding stress to a consumer&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What they want is something that works reliably, is very, very, very simple to use and gets them the outcome they want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, okay, there may be a few different outcomes and I&#8217;m not saying you shouldn&#8217;t have a few different options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the reality is that your consumer is going to choose one of two of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a good argument in favor of creating something very simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years ago, Anita Broderick, I think. The creator of the incredibly successful brand, the body shop said and this was back in the nineties or the two thousands, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When home computers were relatively new thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8221; I think somebody should can invent the computer, which has four buttons on and off, and that come on with the other three where, and she makes a valid point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most computer systems, most domestic appliances. are way more complicated than you need, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could take you indoors and look at the oven. But let&#8217;s look at this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually not too bad as interfaces go, but guess what? When my father in law turned up here, He&#8217;s got an oven, an electric oven like this one. He put this on in order to put the oven on, but guess what that tiny symbol means? Grill. Well, first of all, if you&#8217;re selling products to the UK, why don&#8217;t you put English on them?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s this large language market for English language products, I understand. Like that might include England Australia Canada United States. Right? It&#8217;s not rocket science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first of all, this tiny symbol is supposed to mean grill. And secondly the, there are, there are just even here too many options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the half grill. I kind of get it, but it could be simpler and clearer. Couldn&#8217;t it? So again, there&#8217;s more about clarity than too many options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, this whole oven timer thing, everyone in the world who&#8217;s got an electric oven knows there&#8217;s a timer on it. I don&#8217;t know anyone who uses it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correction. My mum used to use it back in, the 1980s. She doesn&#8217;t even own a microwave. I don&#8217;t know anybody else. And I managed a few properties that we let out. And every time I had to explain how to use the electric oven, because every oven has this, I tell them how to not use the timer. And it&#8217;s always a nightmare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s an example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microwave, another example, right? What do I use? I use start and then stop, right? Why is that? Because Do you know how to adjust the Just intuitively, take a few seconds to look at this. Do you know how to adjust the Power, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This says so many things, microwave, combi, grill, com, wait, time defrost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many flipping functions are you trying to put in one thing and how am I supposed to know what that means?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out if I press this that might be the power, oh that&#8217;s probably power. Does the word power appear on here anywhere? No. So even though John Lewis is a very good consumer brand, John Lewis as a retailer has been in business for well over a hundred years and they&#8217;ve been producing products for a lot of years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re still absolutely in my opinion, screwing up the very, very basic thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what do I do? I press start and that&#8217;s it. And then I stop. Those are the two buttons I use. Guess what? In terms of product design, you could put the start button massive, couldn&#8217;t you? And say, start, plus 30 seconds unconfirmed. You can have that much bigger than the waste of it. And then you can have a power knob that is actually says the word power on it. How about that for rocket science?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So again, you think you got it right because you&#8217;re wrapped up in your products, but you probably haven&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So guess what? You should talk to some consumers, not product designers, not your own marketing team, but people who are going to use your product and then they can give you feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you probably won&#8217;t like the feedback because it&#8217;ll say, no, I don&#8217;t like your design. It&#8217;s too complicated or it&#8217;s not complicated enough, but bear in mind, if you&#8217;re selling a consumer product, you want to be used by an average person. It needs to be simple to use. You shouldn&#8217;t assume an overly high IQ, but even somebody has a high IQ, they&#8217;re not necessarily going to bother reading the manual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I think my IQ is probably somewhere above average. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I haven&#8217;t bothered reading the manual. I&#8217;m the sort of person that reads manuals by the way, but I think I&#8217;m the exception to the rule and I haven&#8217;t bothered reading this manual. Why is that? Because I&#8217;m busy as hell. And I don&#8217;t have time, so don&#8217;t make people a product which forces them to use it only by using a manual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it as idiot proof as possible, and simplify, simplify, and then simplify again. I promise you, you know, this is not only true, but if you think of your experience as a consumer, You absolutely know what I&#8217;m saying is true, but as soon as we get into product design and development and marketing, we forget this truth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just get back to being consumer. And if you&#8217;ve forgotten how to be a consumer, cause you&#8217;re too wrapped up in this particular product and you know too much about it. If I&#8217;d been selling too many microwaves for too long, I wouldn&#8217;t know how ordinary people think about microwaves anymore. Go and ask them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here endeth today&#8217;s rant, Michael Veazey out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2FIs_your_product_confusing_consumers_.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2Fis-your-product-confusing-consumers%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/Is_your_product_confusing_consumers_.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=14999-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/Is_your_product_confusing_consumers_.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"Is_your_product_confusing_consumers_.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 6:36 &#8212; 6.0MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 6:36 &#8212; 6.0MB) Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSS Is your product confusing consumers?
