It focusses on helping more advanced Amazon sellers.<\/p>\n<div>Richard is Danny\u2019s business partner at Seller Sessions.<\/div>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>PPC \/Amazon Adwords<\/h2>\n<h3>Are Amazon sponsored ads still worth using?<\/h3>\n<div>Yes, there definitely is.<\/div>\n<div>Even going back to Danny\u2019s website days, he would always start with PPC (Pay Per Click advertising)<\/div>\n<div>It\u2019s the best way to answer the question &#8211; is there demand?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>If you get good at PPC, it\u2019s a quick way to do this.<\/div>\n<div>You need to find if keywords are converting keywords,\u00a0 not just keywords with good search volume.<\/div>\n<div>And you want to find out as fast as possible.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Is it enough to bid high on Amazon ads to get shown?<\/h3>\n<div>No, Bidding high is not enough now- you need relevance and also some data showing Amazon that there are sales happening via that keyword on a particular listing.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>It\u2019s not category based.<\/div>\n<div>Sometimes sellers run Amazon ads and don\u2019t get impressions (ie nobody sees their ads). Mostly new accounts or or in a new category.<\/div>\n<div>They make a complaint to Amazon etc.\u00a0 but isn\u2019t the solution.<\/div>\n<div>You need sales history to get impressions.<\/div>\n<h3>What \u2019s the solution?<\/h3>\n<div>You need a launch funnel.<\/div>\n<div>Here\u2019s one way Danny does it:<\/div>\n<div>Basically you do giveaways.<\/div>\n<div>\u00a0 1. FaceBook ads with 90% discount<\/div>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>landing page<\/li>\n<li>to Amazon storefront URL and code<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>You may find that your\u00a0 widget &#8211; for example \u201cblue widget\u201d &#8211; may appear for a<\/div>\n<div>e.g. \u201cblue widget left handed\u201d<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Even if it doesn\u2019t yet\u00a0 rank for the main keyword, e.g.,\u00a0 \u201cblue widget\u201d<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>If you started making sales on \u201cblue left handed widget\u201d,\u00a0 you\u2019ll start appearing for blue widget<\/div>\n<div>This will take longer because you also need reviews.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This is based on Danny\u2019s data -yes, it\u2019s based on millions of data points from their clients\u2019 data. But it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t going to change in future!<\/div>\n<h3>So how do you do that?<\/h3>\n<div>Put the keyword In backend<\/div>\n<div>Have as a phrase multiple times in the listing (again, this is a backup procedure; Danny does this based on his data).<\/div>\n<h3>Always follow the people with access to good amounts of data!<\/h3>\n<div>Danny listens to people who have access to a lot of data:<\/div>\n<div>Casey Gauss of Viral Launch, who do 25,000 launches a month;<\/div>\n<div>Brad Moss, who helped build Seller central;<\/div>\n<div>Anthony Lee of Zonblast, who are constantly testing.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Is Amazon ads a tool for launch only? Or is it okay for ongoing sales?<\/h3>\n<div>It certainly is for both. But you need to treat it differently.<\/div>\n<h2>Using Amazon Ads for Launch<\/h2>\n<h3>A case study of Danny\u2019s Recent Launch<\/h3>\n<div>He focussed on 5 keywords\u00a0exact match using sponsored ads.<\/div>\n<div>He worked with external traffic (ie off Amazon).<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Danny sent traffic from google ads to the Canonical URL (product) &#8211; listing with keywords\u00a0 in<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>He also sent [Google] traffic to the storefront page URL.<\/div>\n<div>Plus sponsored ads traffic exact match<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>With this, Danny was converting every 6 clicks (17%) with no reviews<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Danny attributes this to the work they did on the listing.<\/div>\n<div>They spent a lot of time and effort on:<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Images<\/li>\n<li>Right keywords<\/li>\n<li>Listing<\/li>\n<li>Enhanced brand content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>PPC and sponsored ads are only one facet.<\/div>\n<h3>Sponsored Ads for people with larger accounts<\/h3>\n<div>With 100s of SKUs &#8211; you can\u2019t launch across 100s of listings that aggressively &#8211; i.e., bidding high,\u00a0 without a big spend.<\/div>\n<div>On larger accounts, Danny works on profitability.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Is ACoS in isolation a good metric?<\/h3>\n<div>Danny is not a fan of ACoS in isolation.<\/div>\n<div>Not really &#8211; they had a client recently who had a product with 30% ACoS; if they had moved 30-20% ACoS, they would have cut 45-50% of sales. A lot of their conversions were taking place at a high ACoS.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Instead, they look at Return on Investment and profitability.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><strong>\u201cYou can\u2019t break the maths\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>If you\u2019re selling something for \u00a313.99 converting every 10 clicks at \u00a35 a click, that product is dead in the water.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>At some point, you back off the cost per click on short tail keywords.<\/div>\n<div>You\u2019d look for less costly keywords (longer tail) if they are available.<\/div>\n<div>You need to be aware of the ratio between organic and PPC driven sales.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Is there a better metric than ACoS? Is ATS (Advertising to Sales Ratio) good?<\/h3>\n<div>Know what profits are so you know what you can spend per keyword.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Danny\u2019s system will do between 6 and 20 calculations.<\/div>\n<div>But the simple version is: What is your breakeven point? Are you being aggressive?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>When you come onto the platform, you need to not treat PPC as a silver bullet.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Know your margins<\/div>\n<div>Know how much you are willing to or can afford to spend on PPC<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Aggressive<\/li>\n<li>Breakeven<\/li>\n<li>Profitable<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>You don\u2019t always get to choose this! It all starts with product selection.<\/div>\n<div>Danny gets people to come to the agency because they want DataBrill to put things right for them.<\/div>\n<div>But they can\u2019t help them; you can\u2019t escape the maths!<\/div>\n<h2>Launch Strategy for Sponsored Ads<\/h2>\n<div>Assuming that people have made a good market niche choice, have good product quality and sourced at a profitable price, how do you do the launch?<\/div>\n<h2>Case study- Danny\u2019s most recent launch<\/h2>\n<h3>Tools\/Detailed launch funnel<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Facebook ads<\/li>\n<li>WordPress &#8211; landing page &#8211; Danny worked on with developer<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div>eg Japan has no launch pages or India &#8211; font and<\/div>\n<div>Used \u201cAmz coupon server\u201d plugin which costs around $69<\/div>\n<div>This\u00a0 gives away coupon code eg 90% off<\/div>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Ask\u00a0 email address<\/li>\n<li>Thank you page &#8211; instructions on how to claim the coupon code<\/li>\n<li>Link to Amazon &#8211; <a title=\"Click to open in a new window or tab http:\/\/geni.us\/\" href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/\">Geni.us<\/a> &#8211; rotates the URLs, each of which has 3 main keywords<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div>eg. \u201cBlue widget\u201d, \u201cBlue widget left-handed\u201d, \u201cblue and black widget black left handed\u201d<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Facebook ad targeting:\u00a0 Focus on mobile devices only because most people use FaceBook on their mobile.<\/div>\n<div>They use retargeting to reduce costs.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>How Danny uses <a title=\"Click to open in a new window or tab http:\/\/geni.us\/\" href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/\">geni.us<\/a> to rotate URLs<\/h3>\n<div>Using <a title=\"Click to open in a new window or tab http:\/\/geni.us\/\" href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/\">geni.us<\/a> rotate based on operating systems.<\/div>\n<div>Main keyword iOS<\/div>\n<div>2nd window<\/div>\n<div>3rd Android<\/div>\n<div>This is so Amazon sees organic looking results.<\/div>\n<h3>Why do a rotating URL?<\/h3>\n<div>It\u2019s a bit of protection against TOS change eg stop giveaways. On Amazon, giveaways of storefront URLs are okay now.<\/div>\n<div>There are 2 kinds of naysayers<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Never done giveaways and don\u2019t want to do giveaways don\u2019t exist<\/li>\n<li>It doesn\u2019t actually work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Amazon is more competitive than it was. The naysayers who don\u2019t understand it, they want to use the same process each time. It costs them money and they would prefer giveaways didn\u2019t exist! They are criticising things that change, rather than basing things on data.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>You need to move with the times.<\/div>\n<div>\u201cIf you don\u2019t move with the times, this is where people come in,\u2026 disrupt industries and take the industry over.\u201d<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Is this safe? Is it also a review funnel?<\/h3>\n<div>At the moment, all launch services are within ToS &#8211; They are still operational. They work now.<\/div>\n<div>So Danny is happy to do giveaways.<\/div>\n<div>But this is not a review funnel.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Where do people go wrong with ToS?<\/h3>\n<div>They mix reviews with giveaways.<\/div>\n<div>Danny doesn\u2019t build review funnels.\u00a0 He aims to get reviews organically.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>He relies on the quality and pricing of the product; giving value for money.<\/div>\n<div>Spend time on packaging and photos etc. It\u2019s about a premium product at a fair price.<\/div>\n<div>Costs often run away with you. People often try to sell at a high price to make up for that.<\/div>\n<div>BUT you can only sell what the market demands. You\u2019re not Apple!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>If the market price average is \u00a314, \u201cpremium\u201d might be \u00a318.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Why get an email address as opposed to going on straight on to the listing?<\/h3>\n<div>Some people just go straight through to the listing; of course, it reduces friction.<\/div>\n<div>Make sure you understand GDPR and have processes in place. (This is for those based in the European Union including of course the UK).<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Pre GDPR Danny was following up not for reviews but asking how people using the product and if any other issues.<\/div>\n<div>That was very helpful because they caught an issue last time before it became a 1-star review.<\/div>\n<div>Danny gave people money back and a free product and thank you note.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>They are still YOUR customers because they signed up with you before they reached the Amazon system.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h2>Is your initial traffic for a launch just from FaceBook?<\/h2>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>It used to be that Danny would just use FaceBook ads to launch;\u00a0 then prop up a listing with Amazon Ads.<\/div>\n<div>But Danny is always experimenting. Now Danny is doing exact match sponsored ads for launch as well. The proof will be to see how organic sales work!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Danny is also running Google Adwords. The issue is that you can\u2019t track sales going from Adwords to the product page.<\/div>\n<div>You could if you use an Amazon affiliate account &#8211; but it\u2019s risking your account to run it to your own listings. It\u2019s not worth the risk to Danny.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>But you can track sponsored ads sales.<\/div>\n<div>And can track anything sold via discount codes (including sales from the FaceBook ads funnel)<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>If people want to discuss working with Danny<\/h3>\n<div><a title=\"Send an email to Danny@databrill.com\" href=\"mailto:Danny@databrill.com\">Danny@databrill.com<\/a><\/div>\n<div><a title=\"Click to open in a new window or tab http:\/\/www.sellersessions.com\/agency\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sellersessions.com\/agency\">www.sellersessions.com\/agency<\/a><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Usually bigger sellers<\/div>\n<div>30+ SKUs, can put a package together<\/div>\n<div>If 1-2 SKUs, DIY, learn it yourself<\/div>\n<h3><strong>Watch my full interview with Danny McMillan<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5a__UWqExrk&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F271.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F271-sponsored-ads-advanced-sellers%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/271.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=4649-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/271.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"271.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 42:45 &#8212; 34.6MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 42:45 &#8212; 34.6MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSToday we will be talking about sponsored ads with Danny McMillan worked in the music industry for years.\u00a0From about 2008, he created a website and was responsible for managing that site including running Pay Per Click Traffic.\u00a0In 2015, Danny started [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4652,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","enabled":false}}},"categories":[4],"tags":[1853,1112,1111,720,1110],"class_list":["post-4649","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-amazon-fba","tag-amazing-fba-podcast","tag-amazon-marketing-agency","tag-amazon-sponsored-ads","tag-sponsored-ads","tag-sponsored-products","post-wrapper","thrv_wrapper"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Sponsored Ads for Advanced Sellers with Danny McMillan<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Danny created a website and was responsible for managing that site including running Pay Per Click Traffic.
