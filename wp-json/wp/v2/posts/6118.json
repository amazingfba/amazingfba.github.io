When I look at my habits, I find that I\u2019m generally an Early Majority kind of person. Younger people will generally be earlier adopters, and older people are typically later adopters. I live in London in a relatively wealthy area.\u00a0Generally, metropolitan areas are earlier adopters.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>My own communication trends<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Email<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The early \u201890s at university &#8211; ignored email.<\/p>\n<p>Office work email the early 2000s<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Mobile\/cell phone<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I had an experience where it really benefitted me that a friend of mine had a mobile phone, and he called this a \u201cMobile moment\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Got my first mobile in the Early 2000s.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>SMS messaging<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Early 2000s texting\/SMS<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays have serious conversations with wife inc arguments via SMS!<\/p>\n<p>Plus arrange music teaching or gigs (the latter possibly backed up by email).<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Skype messaging<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Began using this tool in 2015.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Zoom video calls<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Then moved to Zoom video calls in 2016.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Facebook Messenger<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Been using increasingly since 2015, about the time I started running the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/fb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazing FBA Facebook group<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook messenger has been increasingly utilized for organising groups, such as with the 10K Collective Mastermind. It is much more interactive and has useful features such as the poll. And now, it has become a means of communication that is a first go to option for arranging work. For example, I recently spoke with a friend about a pianist job and we communicated solely using Facebook Messenger.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s Not \u201cEither\/Or\u201d But \u201cBoth\/And\u201d\u2019 (Tim Ferriss)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Old channels don\u2019t disappear<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Often times conversations may move from messenger to email, particularly when it is with an older, more formal person.<\/p>\n<p>New technology doesn\u2019t always replace old technology. They can coexist and be used differently.<\/p>\n<p>One or two members of 10K Collective mastermind miss info occasionally because they don\u2019t check FaceBook often, or at all.<\/p>\n<p>For the dissemination of important information, you need to use the form of communication which is most widespread among your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Many people are only on 1 of your communication channels. Others only respond to one!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>\u201cThree connection point\u201d theory<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>To feel connected to a person, the theory says we need to see them in 3 places or 3 times.<\/p>\n<p>In the physical world<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maybe that\u2019s 3 dates for a romantic partner.<\/li>\n<li>Or 3 meetings for business. (There is advice to have at least 3 meals with someone before considering going into a business partnership with them!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Virtual connections<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In the virtual world, I think that\u2019s even more important because the connections are more tenuous and there\u2019s more distraction.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have the exact stats, but I believe there is a strong crossover between the Amazing FBA channels:<\/p>\n<p>the podcast audience, my email subscribers, Youtube watchers, and the Facebook Group Members.<\/p>\n<p>I suspect many people are connected to me via at least 2, as the same names crop up in different places.<\/p>\n<p>For Amazon sellers and ecommerce, there is a trap of only being visible to people on Amazon, and only when Amazon decides to show us.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the year where it is more critical to connect with people in as many was as you can.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Example: Mentoring Contest<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I recently talked about my mentoring contest at the beginning of a recent podcast episode. I also sent people a certain link via email marketing.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both of these channels have produced substantial numbers of entrants to the contest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So if I had ignored one at the expense of the other, I think it would have been a lot less successful.<\/p>\n<p>More speculative, they have reinforced each other.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If someone heard about it on the podcast, and also received emails about the podcast, I suspect that the extra communication may have encouraged some people to enter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is an overlap<\/p>\n<h2><strong>However, there are preferred\/growing channels of communication<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Messenger is gradually becoming a preferred channel of communication between myself and clients for Amazing FBA.<\/p>\n<p>For communication with my team, however, we use Skype.<\/p>\n<p>And for group calls and 1-1 consulting, Zoom is my preferred method.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow your own style<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Not every trend is for you<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Messenger is a trend, but that trend may not work for you.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, Instagram is a platform where I have a personal account from years ago but literally haven\u2019t posted for <em>years.<\/em><\/li>\n<li>For many marketers, Twitter was very big, but I don\u2019t like it, so I don\u2019t use it and I\u2019m not going to focus on it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re not a FaceBook user or messenger user, it may be that your business should NOT focus on this.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>But even if your <em>business<\/em> is going to use it, if you\u2019re not a power user yourself, you may need to engage someone (probably younger!) who is into that that can be helpful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Star Principle theory tells clearly what we should do :<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3>To learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00GW4RXMQ\">The Star Principle<\/a>, I highly recommend this book.<\/h3>\n<p>If you spot a growing market and believe you can be the market leader, you should invest, invest, invest!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, if Facebook Messenger is going to be the next big thing, get into it big time. It is a growing trend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Paul Harvey provided me with some stats when he was on a <a href=\"\/285\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent episode of the podcast<\/a>, and he said that only about 5% of businesses have any sort of Chatbot or Messenger presence.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is important because messages on Messenger get about a 90% open rate, which compares to about 20%, at best, for email.<\/li>\n<li>And the click rate for Messenger is about 10%, as opposed to 1-2% for emails.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Right now IS a sweet spot to get into and dominate messenger marketing.<\/p>\n<p>I recently started learning about Seller Chatbot, the new software specifically designed for ecommerce and Amazon sellers by Paul Harvey.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll put up a video of me playing with the software.
