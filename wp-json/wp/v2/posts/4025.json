If you\u2019re not yet on Amazon or playing with the business model, this episode is for you.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Is it Too Late for Amazon Beginners<\/h2>\n<p>The question is whether or not Amazon is saturated and if it\u2019s too late to get in. My answer comes in two parts. If your business model is research using magical tools that give you numbers, go out and buy \u00a35000 worth of product from a Chinese supplier, then you\u2019re on the wrong track.<\/p>\n<p>This practice might have worked in 2013, but it doesn\u2019t anymore. Back then there was a huge surge in demand because so many buyers were coming onto the platform and sellers couldn\u2019t meet that demand. Things are quite different now and that only works if you have deep pockets. If you\u2019re an Amazon beginner, you need to revise your strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>Is Entrepreneurship Right for You<\/h2>\n<p>You have to be willing to take some hits. You\u2019re going to have some setbacks and if you\u2019re too risk averse you\u2019re not going to make it as an entrepreneur. I\u2019m sorry to be so harsh, but better to learn it now rather than after your bank account is \u00a310k smaller. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re a good fit to be an entrepreneur. Then ask yourself if you should take that online. There a plenty of offline opportunities such as trading and real estate. That can work very well for some people.<\/p>\n<h2>The Next Step for an Amazon Beginner<\/h2>\n<p>If you have decided you want to be an entrepreneur and you\u2019ve settled on Amazon, then you need to figure out how to do it. I\u2019ve told you how the old business model is no longer viable. Now I want to tell you about the alternative. I\u2019ve spent the past three years working with sellers in my <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/mastermind\">mastermind groups<\/a> and in my <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/mentoring\/\">mentorship program<\/a> and I\u2019ve come up with a business model that doesn\u2019t take you from A to Z in one leap like Superman but rather teaches you how to properly sell on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re probably trying to figure out if the Amazon thing is for real and how to get started without massive risk up front. I\u2019m all for risk reduction. Keep in mind that Amazon isn\u2019t risk-free, and you have to be willing to take risks, but it has to be a calculated risk. You can reduce risk with proper research and testing products before going all-in. You can do that with tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/junglescout\">JungleScout<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/azanalyzer\">AZAnalyzer<\/a>. AZAnalyzer is my new favourite tool created by Reed Menssa and you can find out more about it in <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/reed\">his interviews<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Start Off Right as an Amazon Beginner<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve never sold anything on Amazon, I don\u2019t believe you should start with private label. You really have no business going to China and buying thousands of pounds worth of stuff. You need to learn the Amazon system. The best way to do that is with retail arbitrage or by selling things around your house.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you could start off by yourself and figure it out on your own, but I prefer to hire someone that knows what they\u2019re doing. This helps eliminate the learning curve and the opportunity cost is way bigger than you think. The money in your pocket is important, but it\u2019s nothing compared to the money you\u2019ll miss out on by wasting months or even years trying to learn how to do it. I would have wasted over $100k had I not gotten help.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to get started is by seeking expert help on retail arbitrage. Not as a business model, but as a prelude to private label. It\u2019s a way to learn the basics of Amazon. From there you would move to a bigger order, something like a wholesale order, and scale up to private label.<\/p>\n<h2>The Space Shuttle Model<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m referring to it as a space shuttle model as opposed to a moonshot model. With a moonshot, you have one chance and it either works or it\u2019s a disaster. With a space shuttle, you can go in and out of space many times. This is going to be a face-to-face training. There will be no online course. That may change down the line but I wanted to start with face-to-face. I\u2019ve teamed up with Christian Rodwell of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.etrr.online\/\">Escape the Rat Race blog and podcast<\/a> where he has great guests and explores several types of business strategies.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re going to have some taster sessions as well as my full course. That will be split over three days coving the three phases: niche, source, and launch. For only \u00a320 plus the booking fee you can join us for this course. It will be Tuesday, the 20<sup>th<\/sup> of April from 6:30 to 8:30 in central London; also the 10<sup>th<\/sup> of April from 6:30 \u2013 8:30. If you want to check that out, just head over to <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/taster\">amazingfba.com\/taster<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re seeking the reality of selling on Amazon rather than the fantasy or overly risky, you\u2019ll want to join us.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon for Beginners &#8211; the CORRECT business model for Beginners<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KG9GAeIV61Y&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F231.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F231-amazon-beginner%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/231.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=4025-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/231.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"231.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 10:53 &#8212; 9.1MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 10:53 &#8212; 9.1MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSI have a very special episode today if you&#8217;re an Amazon beginner.
