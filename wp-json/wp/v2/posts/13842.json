In this episode, we&#8217;ll take a look at some of the most common mistakes that Amazon sellers make when it comes to influencer marketing, and provide tips for how to avoid them. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned seller or just getting started, these insights will help you get the most out of your influencer marketing efforts and drive more sales for your business.<\/p>\n<h2>Background<\/h2>\n<div class=\"w-full border-b border-black\/10 dark:border-gray-900\/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] md:flex-col lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">\n<p>Tomer Hen is a business professional based in Los Angeles, California. He has a wealth of experience working with big companies, including Amazon, to help them gain users. In addition to his work with these larger companies, Tomer has also founded his own &#8220;biohacking&#8221; supplements brand.<\/p>\n<p>As he looks to build relationships with influencers, Tomer is launching his brand with a modest budget, relying on relationships and micro influencer strategies to help get the word out about his products. While he has done many interviews in the past, this is the first time he has spoken about his influencer marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Before delving into the world of ecommerce, Tomer had a team that he worked with to build sales funnels and handle other important tasks like copyrighting. His company, Mobco Media, has been around for ten years, and he works with a variety of brands, with about 70% of his business focused on Amazon. Despite this focus on Amazon, Tomer is also interested in building relationships with direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands. Overall, he leans towards a DTC model, believing that most brands do influencer marketing wrong.<\/p>\n<h2>Time Stamps<\/h2>\n<p>01:56:76 | An Introduction About Mobco Media<br \/>\n02:54:88 | How to Launch A New Brand?<br \/>\n05:50:68 | The Definition of Influencer Marketing<br \/>\n08:35:16 | How Are You Going To Find Or Choose The Influencers?<br \/>\n10:14:58 | What Drives Influencers?<br \/>\n13:35:56 | How Do We Go About This In Practice?<br \/>\n22:19:04 | Is Using Influencer Shout-Outs Work?<br \/>\n25:47:07 | How Do We Find Possible Influencers?<br \/>\n29:53:23 | What Servicers Do You Offer?<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How To Launch a New Brand on Amazon with Influencer Partnerships<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Welcome to our discussion on how to launch a new brand on Amazon with influencer partnerships. Our guest today is TOMER HEN of Mobco media, a company that helps brands grow their profits through influencer partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Tomer had a conversation with a founder who is working on launching a new supplement brand. This <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/brand-identity-definition\/\">brand<\/a> is entering a very competitive space, but with the right strategy, it can still succeed. One key way to stand out is by building credibility and social proof outside of Amazon, and then using that to your advantage on the platform. For example, if an influencer endorses your product and directs their followers to your Amazon listing, it can be more effective than having a high number of reviews on your own.<\/p>\n<p>Tomer&#8217;s company, Mobco media, has been around for 10 years and has worked with big brands like L&#8217;Oreal and Amazon. In the past two years, they have focused on helping supplement and food founders grow their businesses. If you&#8217;re launching a new brand on Amazon, Tomer and his team at Mobco media can help you leverage influencer partnerships to give your brand the best possible chance of success.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible\">\n<h3><strong>What Drives Influencers? Is It Just Relationship-Driven or Is it Real Business?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div class=\"w-full border-b border-black\/10 dark:border-gray-900\/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] md:flex-col lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">\n<p>Influencers, also known as content creators or social media influencers, are individuals who have a significant online presence and the ability to influence their followers&#8217; purchasing decisions. Many influencers are able to monetize their platforms through sponsored content, where they promote products or services to their audience in exchange for compensation.<\/p>\n<p>But what drives influencers to create content and collaborate with brands? Is it just about building relationships or is there a real business aspect to it?<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, it&#8217;s a dance between the two. Influencers often build relationships with their followers and the brands they work with, as they rely on their audience&#8217;s loyalty and engagement to sustain their platforms. At the same time, they also want to get value from their talent and hard work, whether that&#8217;s in the form of monetary compensation or access to cool products that can enhance their own personal <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/brand-identity-definition\/\">brand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One priority for influencers is to keep their audience loyal and engaged, as they know they have a lot of competition for attention. This is especially true in the world of video content, where it&#8217;s hard to fake enthusiasm and authenticity is key.<\/p>\n<p>For brand owners, working with influencers can be a great way to reach a targeted audience and promote their products or services. However, it&#8217;s important to approach influencers with respect and in the spirit of giving before asking. This might mean offering free products in exchange for a post, or enrolling influencers in an ambassador program. While not all collaborations will lead to long-term partnerships, a small percentage will, and these can be extremely valuable for both parties.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Do We Go About This in Practice, Looking Into Influencer Marketing Mistakes?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<div class=\"w-full border-b border-black\/10 dark:border-gray-900\/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] md:flex-col lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">\n<p>Reaching out to influencers can be a valuable way to build relationships, increase brand awareness, and drive conversions for your business. When it comes to deciding how to reach out, it&#8217;s important to consider the influencer&#8217;s preferences and your own goals. For example, if you&#8217;re looking for a quick response, you might consider using a direct message (DM) on social media. If you want to provide more detailed information or have a longer conversation, email might be a better option. Regardless of the method you choose, it&#8217;s important to offer something of value to the influencer, such as a free product, exclusive access, or a discount code.<\/p>\n<p>When you make your offer, it&#8217;s common for influencers to ask &#8220;what do you expect in return?&#8221; It&#8217;s important to be honest and professional in your response, and consider offering something that aligns with the influencer&#8217;s interests and goals. To make the decision to work with influencers more measurable and justifiable, it&#8217;s helpful to track and measure the success of your campaigns using tools like unique discount codes and social media analytics. By following these tips, you can effectively reach out to influencers and build mutually beneficial relationships.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Do We Make This a More Measurable\/Justifiable Decision and Avoid <\/strong><strong>Influencer Marketing Mistakes<\/strong><strong>?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible\">\u00a0When it comes to making the decision to work with influencers, it&#8217;s important to consider the potential ROI and whether the investment is justified. While a paid shout-out from an influencer may seem more tangible, it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that the influencer may not have a genuine interest in the product and may not provide ongoing support or engagement.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div class=\"text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible\">On the other hand, offering free product to influencers can be a more cost-effective way to build relationships and get valuable feedback. By putting out 50 units of product and tracking the results, you can justify increasing the number to 100 or 200, and you can also use the resulting content (e.g. social media posts, reviews) to benefit your business in other ways (e.g. website, email list, paid ads, user-generated content). Additionally, by creating content through this approach, you can often save money compared to creating banner ads or other paid content, and you can also differentiate your brand by proudly stating that your partnerships are not paid. From a budgeting perspective, it&#8217;s important to view this as a way to create valuable content rather than just a cost.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible\">\n<h2><strong>Resources<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Free video series &#8211;
