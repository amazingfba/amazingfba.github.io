They send someone to factory and send report.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Others are more like $300 for one man day e.g Asian inspection for difficult products like electronics. But no use for say a comb or a brush. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you approach Quality Control for electronics particularly? The advice famously is to avoid electronics from China. [I had about 10% defect rate]<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Manuel has 17 years\u2019 experience in electronics, knows what certificates are needed and which components to inspect. He doesn\u2019t recommend it as 1st or 2nd product.<br \/>\nBut just get certificates, experts in electronics inspection. There is a higher defect rate &#8211; Manuel\u2019s is about 4%. Lots of customers just don\u2019t know how to deal with electronics, so they often send it back even though it\u2019s working perfectly. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Is there a way to reduce defect rates?<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Take reviews and customer complaints &#8211; Speak to supplier &#8211; 5\/10 of reviews have this issue, can you improve on this? Also speak to inspection company and have them focus on those issues in future inspections. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">But Manuel does all this and still has 4% defect rate. Anything below 5% is okay<\/span>\u00a0 <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">in electronics. Above that, consider abandoning the product.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_69\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=69\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Freight Handling of Sourced Products for Amazon Merchant Store<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Air freight vs Air Courier: What&#8217;s the difference? <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Air courier means someone like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dhl.co.uk\/en.html\">DHL<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.upstoday.com\/\"> UPS<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fedex.com\/gb\">Fedex<\/a> etc. They have special customs clearance channel and they handle the whole process for you. So it\u2019s more expensive. An \u201cAll in\u201d solution &#8211; where to pick up, where to deliver. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Air freight is same process but it\u2019s usually a logistics company that works with big airlines e.g. China Airlines. There is more paperwork involved and you need to be involved. You need a customs bond, you are the ultimate consignee. You need to know the process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manuel has had rates for air courier of $4 \/kg and for air freight of $2.30\/kg so it can be a $2 difference. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Simplest solution is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sellerapp.com\/blog\/how-to-get-your-shipments-from-china-to-amazon-fba\/\">ask the supplier about air courier or freight<\/a>. Or ask their freight forwarder. Give them USA\/UK address, tell them you need duties\/import taxes upfront.<br \/>\nIf supplier has no Freight Forwarder, just look on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alibaba.com\/trade\/search?fsb=y&amp;IndexArea=product_en&amp;CatId=&amp;SearchText=freight+forwarder+china+to+usa\">Alibaba<\/a> or Google. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>If you have to do DDU [Delivered Duty Unpaid], how do you avoid problems?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Suppliers usually have no idea how to deal with freight etc. &#8211; they are experts at manufacturing. Manuel works with a Freight Forwarding company DDP [Delivered Duty Paid]-it\u2019s all in. They pick up at factory, they ship it direct to Amazon. He doesn\u2019t get involved in customers clearance or amazon pickup appointments. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the beginning he had to explain how to book appointments with Amazon. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>So you ship direct to Amazon?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes. Always directly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freightos.com\/freight-resources\/amazon-fba-freight-shipping\/\">from China to Amazon warehouse. <\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What do you do about damage to packaging from Air Freight?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s a small percentage. Always put a label saying \u201cFragile, handle with care\u201d &#8211; this helps. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How did you train your Freight Forwarder?<\/b><br \/>\n<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They are based in Shenzhen head office. They knew how to deliver to USA -but they had never delivered to Amazon. Manuel chose based on price and helpfulness but had to train them in delivering to Amazon.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>He gave them a clear workflow. After 2nd order, no more hiccups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>So you don\u2019t want someone who doesn\u2019t know about exporting to USA?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">True. If you can find someone with great price and knows about delivery to Amazon, even better. \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Manuel recommends <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dolphin-gp.com\/index.php\"><span class=\"s2\">Dolphin Logistics<\/span><\/a><span class=\"s1\">, based in Shenzhen. Reach out to Manuel if you want more info. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How did you get $2.30\/kg air freight price?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">$6 for air courier is average. Manuel gets good prices because he ships 28 m3 a month!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To make it simple, give your air freight forwarders a clear business process. Tell them they need to deal with Customs brokers and make appointments with Amazon. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They can set up a Vendor Express account with Amazon to set up appointments (they can\u2019t just turn up at an Amazon warehouse!)<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you send inventory direct to Amazon from China? I guess you save money with intermediate steps but what are the risks and how to you mitigate them?<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manuel thinks<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>it can all be done cheaper in China. Get them to put FNSKU barcode on inner packaging, prepare cartons according Amazon requirements e.g. size, send them the shipping labels from Amazon seller central and you\u2019re good to go. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have more than 20 cartons, the supplier needs to <b>palletise<\/b> the boxes in China, otherwise Amazon will give you a hard time! \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">If you have fewer, it\u2019s okay for <b>Floor Loading<\/b>. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How else can you speed up your supply chain? <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t take care of the details yourself. If you have 10-15 products and have customer service, taking photos, etc etc &#8211; outsource everything you can to inexpensive VAs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Focus on growing your business: \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">New products<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Optimising listings.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">New eCommerce Channels<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Retail! Go\u00a0to local store and ask if they want say 50 units. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tell us more about expanding business &#8211; selling to retailers<\/b> <\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manuel actually started own business selling to retailers (through his time in HK) because he just thought Amazon was another eBay. It\u2019s easier to start on Amazon, built a brand, built a reputation for products then reach out to retailers, DIY stores etc etc to sell wholesale. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Any other tips on the best way to approach retailers?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Start locally. Look into smaller importers that set to big brands at an exhibition &amp; approach local distributors. If you can\u2019t go physically go to exhibitions, go to exhibition websites and check then names of companies that exhibit, check them out and email them! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy name is X, this is my brand, I\u2019m importing direct from China, are you interested in buying?\u201d<br \/>\n<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are there other ways other than unique products and high quality to protect your brand against competition?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One thing is to have Amazon brand registry. Other than that, be better in terms of quality. Don\u2019t give the competition grounds to attack you &#8211; quality, customer service &#8211; try to be an awesome company. Even if first few months not highly profitable, eventually it will pay off. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is your prediction for competition in the next year or two? How do we protect ourselves?<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manuel had 6 enquiries last month in his sourcing company for a product that everyone is selling! Nobody has any imagination, it seems!<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\nBe unique, have expertise in your product and be creative. Yes, competition is increasing but so is the market &#8211; Amazon has 51% of the (USA) online sales. There will always be a customer for [good] products. The USA population is about 300 million people!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">CONTACT <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How can listeners find out more about you or learn more from you? <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Go to <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/importdojo\"><span class=\"s2\">importdojo.com<\/span><\/a> &#8211; there is a contact us page &#8211; or email <a href=\"mailto:mail@importdojo.com\"><span class=\"s2\">mail@importdojo.com<\/span><\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_69\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=69\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS PODCAST<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A podcast is a free downloadable audio show that enables you to learn while you\u2019re on the go.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>To subscribe to my podcast for free, you\u2019ll need an app to listen to the show from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For iPhone\/iPad\/iPod listeners \u2013 Grab your phone or device and go to the iTunes store and search \u201cAmazing FBA\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will help you to download the free Podcasts App (produced by Apple) and then subscribe to the show from within that app.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Every time I produce a new episode, you\u2019ll get it downloaded right away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For podcast enthusiasts \u2013 If you already listen to podcasts and have a podcatcher that you prefer, the feed you\u2019ll need to add is: http:\/\/ amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who don\u2019t have a mobile device \u2013 You can always listen to the show by clicking the audio file at the top of this page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have any queries, just go to www.amazingfba.com\/ask<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Keep Money Safe, Quality Control And Freight With Manuel Becvar Of Import Dojo<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4lvg-2GeRMQ&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F_52_Manuel_Becvar_2-auphonic.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F53-china-sourcing-for-amazon-keep-money-safe-quality-control-and-freight-with-manuel-becvar-of-import-dojo-part-2-of-2%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-2\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_52_Manuel_Becvar_2-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=562-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_52_Manuel_Becvar_2-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"_52_Manuel_Becvar_2-auphonic.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 35:46 &#8212; 32.8MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Amazon sellers &#8211; rejoice!
