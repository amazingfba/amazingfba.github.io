He\u2019s the founder of <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/forecastly\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forecastly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He has been selling on Amazon for over 10 years so he has a really deep understanding of the marketplace and of Amazon inventory management and the issues that can involve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He was one of the first FBA sellers in the office supply space running a multi-million dollar operation. Jeremy has a strong knowledge of Amazon and what it takes to maintain your Amazon inventory.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tell us more about yourself and how you got started.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming out of college about 15 years ago, Jeremy was working in the corporate world doing marketing and sales. Quickly realized that the corporate life wasn\u2019t for him. He got into selling \u00a0Amazon inventory \u00a0part-time while working the corporate job. He happened upon office supplies. Not the sexiest products but he found a place. He realized that he could make more money selling on Amazon than in his full-time job and he enjoyed it much more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He started selling full-time 8 years ago. Then, about 2 years ago, the office supply space wasn\u2019t going in the right direction. He heard from a lot of other FBA sellers about their Amazon inventory issues. Jeremy had the answer. He had custom software they used in-house. He decided to take this software, improve it so it could be mass-distributed, and began <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/forecastly\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forecastly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What prompted you to create this custom software for Amazon inventory?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a combination of stock-outs and excess Amazon inventory. At first, they were just using the reports you get from seller central. It shows how much you have in stock and how much you sold in the past, like 30 days. It would be 30 days later, after he had placed all those orders, and looked at his profit and loss and think that he should have sold more. As it turns out their estimations were off. He knew from the beginning that using the inventory reports from Amazon wouldn\u2019t cut it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tell us about how you used the Amazon inventory reports and what the limitations were.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of the time, those aren\u2019t accurate. Looking at your current Amazon inventory and your inbound numbers. You inventory is usually right, but your inbounds number aren\u2019t. They didn\u2019t know exactly what was going into Amazon. What status was it in. Even looking at your existing Amazon inventory, you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s being labeled, is it moving around the country, or is it reserved because it\u2019s already been sold. If I have 100 units, and 10% has already been sold, I really have 90.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other piece of it is figuring out your sales velocity. That\u2019s not as easy as many people think it is. Let\u2019s say you sold 50 units last month. If you don\u2019t know if you were in stock the entire time, your don\u2019t know your true sales velocity. If you sold 50 in the last 30 days, but you were out of stock half that time, you should have sold 100. However, those reports are saying you sold 50, and if you want a 30 day supply, you should buy 50 more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last piece to this is taking that demand forecast and building a replenishment strategy off it. Knowing when you\u2019re going to run out of stock.There isn\u2019t an Excel spreadsheet that will tell you if you\u2019re going to have a spike in sales. The only way to do that is by using a database and running some crazy statistical calculations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming back to why this matters. One thing you mentioned was demand forecasting. Basically, you have to think about this before you place your very first order, if you\u2019re new to Amazon. Or when releasing a new SKU. How do you work this out?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is something Jeremy sees a lot of mistakes with. Even if you\u2019re an experienced private label seller and you&#8217;re bringing out a new product. It\u2019s tough trying to figure out how much to order. Some things you want to think about when releasing a new product<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long, from the time I tell my supplier that I want to place an order, to the day it actually arrives at the Amazon warehouse. There is a lot that has to happen in the time-frame.<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lead time<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want to consider payment processing. Your money doesn\u2019t show up immediately. Sometimes it takes a couple days to process your payment with the bank. The suppliers won\u2019t do anything until that payment processes. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturing time<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long will it take for the factory to actually make the product. Is it going to be reliable? Will it take the length of time they quote you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipping time<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preparation of shipping. If you\u2019re placing a large order, it\u2019s going to take time to process that shipment. Then sea or air time. Then is has to come through customs. There can be a lot of delays here. Then is has to be sent to Amazon where it will sit on their dock until they can receive it. If you send it to your house first, or a third-party preparer, all that takes time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People will underestimate their lead time, and throw off the whole process. That goes for existing products as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just to underline how important this is, it will always take longer than you expect. If a factory quotes you 2 weeks, it will likely take longer. They will tell you what you want to hear. If you send it to a prep facility, it could sit there for 3 weeks. Don\u2019t underestimate receiving time at Amazon if it\u2019s around Christmas or other holidays.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there someone magic trick that you use to determine actual time frames when a manufacturer quotes you?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of reality, it\u2019s going to come down to you putting some pressure on them. Communication is key. Contact them saying that you\u2019re going with them. You like the communication so far. How likely do you think we\u2019re going to hit that three week mark? Should I account for an extra week in there? They\u2019re people too. It will put them at ease knowing that they got the order and don\u2019t have to tell you what they think you want to hear. There really isn\u2019t a magic formula because each supplier is different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>You can add in a late delivery penalty. Let them know that it\u2019s your company\u2019s policy that there is a 10% penalty for every week past the deadline. You see this difference between new and veteran sellers. If you ship an order to Amazon and it\u2019s late, you\u2019re going to be hit with a charge-back. This is also dependent\u00a0on your payment agreement. If you pay everything up front, you can\u2019t go and take that back. Whereas if you make a partial payment before delivery, it\u2019s a bit different.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main point is to get a straight answer out of them. They are likely to be more honest if they will get less money if they try to be overly-optimistic. Most terms I recommend is 70% up front, and 30% balance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One point Jeremy wanted to make sure to hit on is about new product and why lead time matters. It\u2019s not lead time for your first initial order. It\u2019s thinking ahead to your next order. Let\u2019s say your very first order arrives today and you have a 45 day lead time. Now you have to think about your next order. If you didn\u2019t order enough units to get through 45 days, you will run out of product. Even if you place a PO today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t want to place another order for 30 days. If you have a 45 day lead time, you have to order enough for 75 days of inventory. You don\u2019t want to over-order inventory, but you really don\u2019t want to run out. There are a lot of sellers that always order 100 units, or 1000 units. They\u2019re just making up a number. Jeremy recommends looking at <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/junglescout\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JungleScout<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you\u2019re shooting for a rank of 10,000 in the office products category, you can look on JungleScout and estimate how many units you\u2019ll sell in a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So simple formula is LEAD TIME + 30 day. That way you have 30 days of data in which to base your estimate?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly. They have a free Excel spreadsheet that you can get at <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/forecastly\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forecast.ly\/amazingfba<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s a simple sheet that tells you what your lead time is, and when you\u2019ll want to place your next order. The last piece on top of that is safety stock. That is a complicated thing so we won\u2019t go into too much detail. Essentially, it\u2019s insurance against a stock-out. If you think you\u2019ll sell 10 units a day for those 75 days, then you\u2019ll buy 750 units as your initial order. Depending on your level of cash, you\u2019ll bump that up. You may want 10% safety stock. So you\u2019ll add 75 units, just in case sales are higher than expected. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"_form_35\"><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=35\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch Amazon Inventory with Jeremy Biron of Forecastly Part 1 of 3<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221;
