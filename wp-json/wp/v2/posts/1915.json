Sign up below so you can get the details.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/promusickit.activehosted.com\/f\/embed.php?id=101\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s rare that you can ask a lawyer questions for free so let\u2019s get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A with Amazon Sellers Lawyer, CJ Rosenbaum<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clothing and Jewelry Copyrights<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>I keep hearing about so-called \u201cgeneric designs\u201d of clothes and jewelry. I keep hearing about it, but after researching into it, I seem to find this doesn\u2019t exist. For example, at some point in time a piece of jewelry must have been designed by somebody. Are they given to the public like open-sourced software? Is there a database where I can check jewelry copyrights?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can absolutely do a search. You can try it yourself. CJ isn\u2019t familiar with the UK system, but in the US you can go to the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/uspto.gov\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United States Patent and Trademark Office<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and they have kind of an archaic search engine, that you can use to try and find patented products when it comes to anything at all. If you\u2019re not real skilled and you don\u2019t have a lot of patience, you can hire someone to do a search. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many designs are going to have been filed for protection and many will not. It could also be that you start selling a product that someone has already been selling for a number of years and since the US is a first to use rather than a first to file country, you may still have some problems. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t want to get into that product. It\u2019s all risk vs reward. If you think you can make a couple of hundred thousand of pounds in a short amount of time, with a fairly insignificant risk, it might be a good business decision to do that. Other people may avoid taking that risk. It\u2019s a product-by-product and profit-by-profit analysis as to what you\u2019re comfortable doing in terms of taking a risk with a certain product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>There\u2019s one sort of follow-up part to this question, it says, does\u00a0design copyrights just run out? And do factories in China just turn out thousands of replicas? Does it work that way?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are certain IP rights that expire, they become part of the public domain. It really depends on how they\u2019re filed. There are certain designs that are used that have what\u2019s called trade dress, and that does not expire. In generalities, it can&#8217;t be answered. You need to look at the product, look at the investment, and if it costs $300-$500 to get an opinion on that particular product, you decide as a business person whether it\u2019s worthwhile to pay that. Or just make your savvy at checking the listings and seeing what the risks are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a lot of misconceptions about attorney\u2019s fees. You can get good protection and a great amount of information, for a relatively small amount of money in most of the issues Amazon sellers face. It doesn\u2019t hurt to call, they don\u2019t charge to talk to you. You can find out and make the decision yourself. CJ tries to provide every client with a flat fee you know exactly what you\u2019re going to pay and what you\u2019re getting. That way you can make an informed business decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liabilities<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>Who is legally responsible, in the worst case scenario, someone dies from using my private-label product?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a trial lawyer, CJ Rosenbaum had a ton of trials and employee cases for many years. Responsible or not, if someone gets seriously hurt and you touched that product, you\u2019re going to get sued. If someone gets hurt or dies and they have enough money that it\u2019s worthwhile to the lawyer, you\u2019re going to be part of the defendants. If you designed it, if you manufactured it, if you\u2019re the middleman, you\u2019re going to have some responsibility. Even if someone isn\u2019t terribly hurt, the attorney may still reach out to you and try and resolve the case or threatened litigation, which is why product liability insurance is important. Under US law, anybody involved in the entire chain of distribution has potential liability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What kind of insurance do I need to cover all eventualities?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should have a general liability policy which will have a product liability component to it. One of the other benefits of having insurance is that when a lawyer gets that case and is representing an injured person, it makes settlements a lot easier. Insurance companies want to settle it because they don\u2019t want to pay defense costs. It avoids ever having to go to court and brings professional on board that know how to handle this kind of thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Are there international implications of a UK seller, selling in the US, with a US manufacturer?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unlikely there is any difference in profitability or risk. In this day and age, working across borders doesn\u2019t mean that much. As far as liability, it\u2019s probably the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Are there liabilities as a retail, or online arbitrage? That is someone who buys cheap products in a store, like Wal-Mart or Tesco, and re-sell them online for a profit. It\u2019s not your design, you\u2019re not even wholesaling. Do you still have any liability with that product?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your liability for the person who was hurt is very minimal as long as you didn\u2019t alter the product in any way or sell it for a different use. You will still be brought into that lawsuit. You\u2019re still going to have to defend yourself. It will take time for it to work it\u2019s way around until you get a chance to ask a judge to remove you from the suit. There will be depositions and documentary discoveries. It\u2019s only after all that will you have a good chance of getting the judge to let you out of the case. At that point alone, you defense costs could be $20,000-$30,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>If I\u2019m a UK seller and I get sued, would I have to go to New York several times?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Not as often as you would think. Remember, lawsuits over the products are really few and far between. But yes, if you were sued and you\u2019re a one man show, you would hat least have to come in for your deposition, which is a question and answer thing. You would also want to come in if there was a trial. The lawyers will go to the conferences and file the paperwork.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What kind of protection does a UK Limited company give a UK based seller who sells on Amazon.com? Is the director of a Limited Liability company open to personal liability when selling on amazon.com?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CJ Rosenbaum doesn\u2019t know since he isn\u2019t yet a barrister, though he hopes to be within the year. You would likely\u00a0have similar protections as a US corporation or an LLC where your liability is limited to the value of that corporation. There are situations in the US called piercing the corporate veil or director of liability. That requires really bad conduct, though. You would almost have to intentionally put something out there to hurt people, and even then it\u2019s very difficult to come after your personal assets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Branding and Taxes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>How do I go about registering my FBA business and getting my unique tax reference code?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a very simple process to get that and is completely separate than getting your tax ID in the US. CJ doesn\u2019t know the exact process of a foreign company getting a tax ID in the US but he knows it\u2019s not terribly difficult. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What\u2019s the cheapest way to protect my brand in the US in general and on Amazon in particular?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do your trademark application, the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/asl\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Sellers Lawyer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> charges $1200, plus the filing fees which is just under $300 per category. Now, when you call them, for free<i>,\u00a0<\/i><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they can give you a better idea of what it will cost you. The call is free, do don\u2019t be afraid to call them!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as obtaining other protections, it really depends on the product itself. There might be some products where you don\u2019t really need to file and you need to do other things. What people used to do, not that long ago, if they had an idea, they would describe it, write it down on a piece of paper, send it to himself via registered mail, and just keep it and never open it. That way if there was ever a dispute about who had the idea first, you could take that sealed envelope with the date, and show the judge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Is that still effective now?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s better than nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Owes Money<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>One seller had 25 separate shipments sent to Amazon for his 25 variations. It is recommend that you don\u2019t do that as it could lead to confusion on Amazon\u2019s part which is what likely lead to his situation. To make a long story short, they disposed of some of his units in error after customers were complaining about receiving the wrong variation. Amazon\u2019s argument is that the products went unfulfilled for months and the disposal was automatic. His argument is that he is confident they sent him correspondence saying the unfulfillment was due to a mistake in the bin check. What advice would you give to get this resolved?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It sounds like one of two possibilities. One, Amazon made these mistakes which cost sales which costs money. The only way to get the money from Amazon is to take Amazon to arbitration. You could put in a case which may or may not work out. If you\u2019re an ongoing seller, you may shy away from anything that contradicts or creates animosity between you and Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a consulting company that hasn\u2019t launched yet. He\u2019ll be launching in a couple weeks. He is a long-time seller who is really going to focus on this issue and help seller recoup funds that are due to you based upon errors in Amazon\u2019s system. As soon as it launches CJ will provide us with information about the company. The key is to work with Amazon rather than taking an adversarial role because There isn\u2019t another amazon.com or anyone that comes close where you could sell your products. It may not be the best idea to immediately get the lawyers involved as it could make the relationship with Amazon tenuous and cause issues in the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing to keep in mind is that the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/asl\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Sellers Lawyer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aren\u2019t going to rush to court. Their goal is to resolve the issues. After 20 years of trying cases and representing entrepreneurs and reaching agreements, it\u2019s about knowing how to communicate with people in a way that makes them want to resolve things. Brand managers aren\u2019t trying to shut down Mom &amp; Pop shops. They\u2019re trying to protect their business. They don\u2019t want the publicity that comes with that. You can resolve most issues amicably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He recently handled one issue of IP complaint and quote the client at $2500 whereas another lawyer wanted $20,000 up front and wanted to go straight into litigation. Lawyers are very social and CJ know a lot of the lawyers on the other side. It comes down to being able to call up their lawyer and have a friendly conversation. He will ask about the family, and the kids and then he can get into the case and try to work it out. Their goal is always to try and resolve things as quickly as possible and get you back to selling.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get More Information<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to get in touch CJ Rosenbaum, you can find the website at <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/asl\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Sellers Lawyer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
