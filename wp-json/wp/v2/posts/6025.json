This habit has been a touchstone in my life for about 25 years, and when I apply the principles in this book, my life has gone better. I have found that this book is one of the most reliably realistic books about how life actually works.<\/p>\n<p>To hear about the first habit, \u201cBe proactive\u201d, listen to <a href=\"\/284\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">episode 284<\/a>. And to hear the beginning of habit 2, refer to the <a href=\"\/297\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous episode<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind &#8211; part 2 of 2<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>At the Centre [Principle-based centre]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>4 life support\u201d Factors<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Security<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cRepresents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, your basic personal strength or lack of it.\u201d What gives you your feeling of security is going to drive everything about your life. You have to be very thoughtful in designing your life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Guidance <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cmeans your source of direction in life\u2026your internal frame of reference\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wisdom<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201c is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other.\u201d This comes partly from experience, and partly from the decision to learn from experience, which certainly applies to entrepreneurship. It is good to make a conscious decision to reflect on your experiences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Power<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201c is the faculty or capacity to act, the strength and potency to accomplish something. It is the vital energy to make choices and decisions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alternative centres [co-dependency]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>[some common alternatives for Amazon sellers!] <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Spouse [Business partner]<\/p>\n<p>Family [Employees &amp; Engaged people]<\/p>\n<p>Money<\/p>\n<p>Work [Business!]<\/p>\n<p>Church<\/p>\n<p>Possessions [cars, houses\u2026random Amazon products\u2026]<\/p>\n<p>Pleasure [profit, revenue, bragging rights]<\/p>\n<p>Friends [customers]<\/p>\n<p>Enemy [competition\/customers! &#8211; 1* reviews etc.]<\/p>\n<p>Self [own business]<\/p>\n<p><strong>Identifying your Centre<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You really should become very self aware about these things. The best thing is to observe reality and the motivation behind your decisions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Principle Centre<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy centering our lives on correct principles, we create a solid foundation for development of the four life-support factors. Our security comes from knowing that, unlike other centers [sic] based on people or things which are subject to frequent and immediate change, correct principles do not change. We can depend on them.\u201d For example, if you base your life around service, you may think about where you can be of the greatest service.<\/p>\n<p><strong>[The paradigm shift to being centred on principles]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy centering our lives on timeless, unchanging principles, we create a fundamental <em>paradigm<\/em> [pattern] of effective living.\u201d Remember that your<em> paradigm<\/em> is the source from which your attitudes and behaviors [sic] flow. A paradigm is like a pair of glasses; it affects the way you see everything in your life. If you look at things through the paradigm of correct principles, what you see in life is dramatically different from what you see through any other centered paradigm.\u201d For example: Having to work late on your business when you were supposed to go a concert with your spouse\/partner. As a principle-centered person, you try to stand apart from the emotion of the situation and from other factors that would act on you, and evaluate the options. Looking at the balanced whole.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Principle centred<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You are not being acted upon by other people or circumstances. <strong><em>You are proactively choosing<\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>You know your decision is most effective because it is based on principles with <strong><em>predictable long-term results<\/em><\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>What you choose to do <strong>contributes to your ultimate values in life<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>You <strong>can communicate <\/strong>to your spouse and any work colleagues\/business partner(s)<strong>within the strong networks you\u2019ve created<\/strong> in your interdependent relationships.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ll feel <strong>comfortable about your decision<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>[how to be creative in our vision setting]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the two\u00a0 endowments that enable us to practice Habit 2\u2014imagination and conscience\u2014are primarily functions of the right side of the brain. Understanding how to tap into that right brain capacity greatly increases our first creation ability\u2026 Essentially, the left hemisphere is the more logical\/verbal one and the right hemisphere the more intuitive, creative one&#8230;people tend to stay in the \u201ccomfort zone\u201d of their dominant hemisphere and process every situation according to either a right or left brain preference. In the words of Abraham Maslow, \u2018He that is good with a hammer tends to think everything is a nail.\u2019\u201d If you have a very money and goal-centric way of thinking, you will need to integrate that more with your imagination and emotional intelligence.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Two Ways to Tap the Right Brain<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Expand Perspective<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\u201cSometimes we are knocked out of our left brain environment and thought patterns and into the right brain by an unplanned experience\u2026 The death of a loved one, a severe illness, a financial setback, or extreme adversity can cause us to\u2026look at our lives, and ask ourselves some hard questions: \u201cWhat\u2019s really important? Why am I doing what I\u2019m doing? &#8230;But if you\u2019re proactive, you don\u2019t have to wait for circumstances or other people to create [these]. You can consciously create your own.\u201d When experiences happen in life and you reflect on them, that is when wisdom happens. You can also try and be proactive about this reflection instead of waiting for life to happen.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Example 1: Your own funeral!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\u2026you can visualize your own funeral, as we did at the beginning of this chapter. Write your own eulogy. Actually write it out.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Example 2: Your own retirement<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You can visualize your retirement from your present occupation [Amazon business]. What contributions, what achievements will you want to have made in your field? What plans will you have after retirement? Will you enter a second career?<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Example 3: \u201cThe good student\u201d [business owner\/entrepreneur]<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Assume you only have this one semester to live,\u2019 I tell my students, \u2018and that during this semester you are to stay in school as a good student. Visualize how you would spend your semester.\u2019\u201d This can be translated to business when you visualize that you only have one year to life, and during this year you are to stay in your business as a good entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThings are suddenly placed in a different perspective. Values quickly surface that before weren\u2019t even recognized. I have also asked students to live with that expanded perspective for a week and keep a diary of their experiences.\u201d Keeping a diary of your experiences would give you a clue of how you want to live your life.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Visualization &amp; Affirmation<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Example: \u201csupposing you love creativity and independence. You identify that as one of your fundamental values. But suppose on a daily basis I don\u2019t follow that out of fear\u2026 I can use my right brain power of visualization to write an \u201caffirmation\u201d that will help me become more congruent with my deeper values in my daily life.\u201d In other words, I can write an affirmation to keep moving myself in the way of courageous action and getting independence that I crave in the face of my fear.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA good affirmation has five basic ingredients: it\u2019s personal, it\u2019s positive, it\u2019s present tense, it\u2019s visual, and it\u2019s emotional.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So I might write something like this:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is deeply satisfying (emotional) that I (personal) respond (present tense) with [courage and wisdom] (positive) when [faced with a business problem].\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThen I can visualize it. I can spend a few minutes each day and totally relax my mind and body. I can think about situations in which my [my business might push me into fear]. I can visualize them in rich detail.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThen I can [imagine something] very specific which normally makes my heart pound\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut instead of seeing my normal response, I can see myself handle the situation with all the courage &amp; confidence I have captured in my affirmation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2026 write the script\u2026 in harmony with my values. And if I do this, day after day my behavior [sic] will change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For example, I\u2019m not a very calm person and I get wound up on the phone with Amazon sellers. This was simply not doing me any good. It was a massive waste of energy. So I rewrote the script by sending written messages and no longer calling them. It\u2019s easier to be clear in writing. Plus, it helps me keep a calmer and clearer head.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Identifying Roles &amp; Goals<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>\u201cOf course, the logical\/verbal left brain becomes important also as you attempt to capture your right brain images, feelings, and pictures in the words of a written mission statement\u2026 Writing distills, crystallizes, and clarifies thought and helps break the whole into parts.\u201d Sometimes writing a mission statement may not change your entire life. I\u2019ve done things like that in the past. It may not have an impact, but the act of writing it will help you crystallize your thoughts which can be very helpful.<\/p>\n<p>Example of executive mission statement\u2026<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy mission is to live with integrity and to make a difference in the lives of others.<\/p>\n<p><em>To fulfil this mission:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have charity<\/li>\n<li>I sacrifice<\/li>\n<li>I inspire<\/li>\n<li>I am impactful<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>These roles take priority in achieving my mission: <\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Husband<\/li>\n<li>Father<\/li>\n<li>Son\/Brother<\/li>\n<li>Christian<\/li>\n<li>Neighbour [sic]<\/li>\n<li>Change Agent [=]high performance in large organizations<\/li>\n<li>Scholar &#8211; I learn important new things every day<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This person wants to have a life in integrity and to make a difference with his actions. To fulfill that he does certain practical things.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Organizational mission statements<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo be effective, that statement has to come from within the bowels of the organization. Everyone should participate in a meaningful way\u2014not just the top strategy planners, but everyone. Once again, the involvement process is as important as the written product and is the key to its use.\u201d For an entrepreneur, at the very least, the people involved in the equation if you are doing private labelling is you, the supplier, Amazon, and your customers. Amazon probably doesn\u2019t care your mission statement. However, when your are working with your supplier,\u00a0 when you communicate your mission statement, if gives a meaning to your business. You have to stand for something.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Without involvement, there is no commitment. Mark it down, asterisk it, circle it, underline it. No involvement, no commitment.<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Application Suggestions [excercise]<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Record the impressions from funeral visualisation<\/li>\n<li>Write your Roles as they are now. Are you satisfied with this?<\/li>\n<li>Set up time away from daily activities to complete your mission statement<\/li>\n<li>Go through \u201calternative centres\u201d. Do they form a pattern? Are you happy with it?<\/li>\n<li>Start collecting notes, quotes &amp; ideas to build your personal mission statement<\/li>\n<li>ID a project you\u2019ll face in the near future and apply the principle of \u201cmental creation\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Share the principles of Habit 2 with a work group.
