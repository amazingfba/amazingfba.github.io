Once a phase is over, it\u2019s over. So if you don\u2019t plan out where you need to be you very well may end up missing out on what you went there for. By taking 10 minutes to plan out where you need to be at what time, you can save yourself hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The distances between Halls can be over a mile!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. <b>Failure to network<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Take the time to network. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">It gives you energy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"> It creates a great experience because many Amazon sellers are really nice people.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can get invited to WeChat groups which is like your on-demand Siri for the Canton Fair. People in these groups can help you with translations or help getting around if you need it.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. <b>Discussing exact pricing<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At least not specifically. These vendors pay a premium for their stand and they may charge you a premium on your unit cost. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s fine to get a general idea of pricing. Ask what the price would be for 5000 units knowing your initial order will be 500 &#8211; 1000. Use this price to work backwards and get a general guidance on pricing, but don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re agreeing to anything. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you get back home and contact them you\u2019ll be able to come down 5%, but their still playing with the other 25% because of that premium. But three or four weeks later, they might not have made back their money from the fair and will be willing to negotiate a better price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>3. Having wrong footwear.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Taking only leather shoes, not trainers is a big error! Also having just one pair of trainers &#8211; take 2-3 pairs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>4. Staying too far from the Fair\/with no English speakers. <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One mistake Danny says he made was using AirBnB. It is better to pay the premium to stay in the hotel because there won\u2019t be an issue with language barriers and they are able to get you a taxi to the fair. It took them two hours to figure out how to get to the fair because no one spoke english. He finally got wifi and was able to use Google translate to communicate with the cab driver. It really affects the quality and enjoyment of the trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What are some things you need to do post-fair?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Danny says he had a good system with his business partner. He would take a picture of the stand, the product, and the business card on the catalogue. They didn\u2019t want to take the catalogue because it would weigh them down, so they asked for an e-catalogue. And they took pictures with the people in the stand to humanize it. That way when you look back later you will remember who you were dealing with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Next time, Danny plans on using Evernote to link all the pictures and note together. This will save a lot of time. By doing it there, it will be fresh rather than trying to recall it days or a week later. By systematizing the process while you\u2019re there you can save yourself major headaches later on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you handle technology and connectivity in a country where that is notoriously difficult to stay connected?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Danny recommends several apps and solutions. All of these can be found in his wonderful article that he wrote about the Canton Fair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.expressvpn.com\">Express VPN<\/a> &#8211; This is a virtual private network solution. This will allow you to bypass China\u2019s internet restrictions to sites such as Facebook and Google. It has a 30-day money back guarantee. Use it wisely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They use different SIM cards. So you would have to buy one for Hong Kong and another for China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Take some cash with you so you pay for the cab in the beginning because you can\u2019t use a credit card to exchange currency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">JetLag Rooster<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Evernote, as we mentioned before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">WhatsApp<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">WeChat<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Get the Hong Kong app for the trains. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By the way, If you go to the Global Sources fair (in Hong Kong), you don\u2019t have to pay to for transit. Just show them your pass.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In China, Guangzhou Metro app. (iTunes\/Android)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What would you change on your return visit?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Danny plans on doing things a little differently. This is intended for his personal needs, so it might not work for everyone. He\u2019s going to go straight to Hong Kong. Before, it was difficult to travel between countries, so by going directly there he can avoid crossing the borders so much. In Hong Kong, he will do his presentation, then two days of shows. Then take a train into Shenzhen for some niche fairs. He might skip Canton this time around or do only two days. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If he does skip it then he will go to the Yuri Markets which is like a year long Canton Fair. Only it\u2019s tougher finding good products. They will be taking Turkish Air, so while in Turkey they might hit some other markets while there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pro Tip: While there, one of Danny\u2019s suppliers had their own stand and offered to help him navigate the fair as well as translate. So if you already have connections with suppliers you might be able to enlist their help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do people hear more from you, read more from you or contact you?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Danny\u2019s recent article on the Canton Fair for www.webretailer is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webretailer.com\/lean-commerce\/sourcing-trip-china\/\"><span class=\"s2\">here<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dannymcmillan.com\">www.DannyMcMillan.com<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> &#8211; along with the contact information you can find spreadsheets and updates on fixtures and guest speaking gigs as well as booking him for speaking gigs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch How To Do The Canton Fair With Danny Mcmillan \u2013 Part 2 Of 2<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0f4OcoRRQJ0&amp;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F_62_Danny_McMillan_part_2_of_2-auphonic.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F62-how-to-do-the-canton-fair-with-danny-mcmillan-part-2-of-2%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_62_Danny_McMillan_part_2_of_2-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=625-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_62_Danny_McMillan_part_2_of_2-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"_62_Danny_McMillan_part_2_of_2-auphonic.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 28:21 &#8212; 26.0MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 28:21 &#8212; 26.0MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSDanny\u2019s recent article on the Canton Fair for www.webretailer is here What are the 5 biggest mistakes people make attending the fair for the first time?
