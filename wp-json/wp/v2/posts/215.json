Two tactics:<br \/>\n1. Get \u00a0MOQ of unbranded product, Market it normally and see if it sells; if yes, go and get a branded (Private Labelled) version.<\/p>\n<p>2. When\u00a0you go back to your supplier for new inventory, order an MOQ of an \u00a0(unbranded) additional product to test.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mistake #5<\/strong>: Relying on one Traffic Channel (Amazon!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Strategy #5<\/strong>: Develop new Traffic Channels &#8211; \u00a0e.g., YouTube videos, Facebook Page\/Ads, Google Ads, Own Website (more a brand reassurance than a traffic source).<\/p>\n<p>Caveat &#8211;\u00a0one at a time! Don&#8217;t spread yourself too thin. Firstly,\u00a0\u00a0Test properly what works, then systematise what\u00a0works. That includes eliminating time and money wasters (campaigns that bring little or no result), automating (e.g. using software to post content), and eventually delegating to VAs etc.<\/p>\n<p>Mistake #6:\u00a0Not building your own customer lists<\/p>\n<p>Strategy #6: Build your own customer lists- mostly email<\/p>\n<p>Tactic: put in inserts in your product packaging &#8220;To activate your Warranty, go to www.yourbusiness.com\/warranty. Then set up a Landing page aka opt-in page with say WordPress on a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluehost.com\">Bluehost<\/a> hosting or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leadpages.net\">Leadpages<\/a>, and an email autoresponder, e.g.,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.aweber.com\"> aWeber<\/a>. If you don&#8217;t have the know-how, outsource this, e.g., try <a href=\"http:\/\/fiverr.com.\">fiverr.com.\u00a0<\/a><strong><em>I&#8217;m about to create an episode dealing specifically with this. Stay tuned!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mistake #7<\/strong>: Having a Small Back End! Trying to make all your money in the first sale to a new customer<\/p>\n<p><strong>Strategy #7<\/strong>: Create a suite of products that you could sell to existing customers. Especially aim to create and\/or sell digital (information) products because each sale of those is \u00a0nearly all profit!<\/p>\n<p>You can sell other people&#8217;s products initially (try <a href=\"https:\/\/accounts.clickbank.com\/marketplace.htm\">clickbank.com<\/a>) as an affiliate if you don&#8217;t have time\/inclination to create your own products at first.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO
