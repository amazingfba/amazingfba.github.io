Know, Like, Trust. Once again, this isn\u2019t a mindset for you, but that of your consumer which is really important to understand. Stepping back, the most important thing to understand is what marketing means. Marketing isn\u2019t about creating a widget and figuring out how to sell a lot of it. It may look like that, but marketing is really understanding markets. Simply put, supply and demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Markets<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you start by understanding the markets, and find what people are looking for, then create a product that fulfills that need, that it truly smart marketing. To take a pre-existing product, and then try to sell it is much more primitive and difficult to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/124\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last episode<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we talked about message to market match. If you are the only person selling <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">red<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dog bowls, even though a lot of people are selling dog bowls, you win. The caveat to that is credibility. I gave the example of trying to sell the world\u2019s best dog food to cat owners and how you won\u2019t find success with that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, imagine you have that same dog food in a room full of dog owners, except that you are trying to give this amazing dog food away for free. That puts the questions in people\u2019s minds. Why in the world would someone be willing to give away this great product for free? How can this dog food do everything it claims?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KLT: Know, Like, Trust<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a simple marketing principle of KLT. Know. Like. Trust. These are the elements we need to have in place before people will buy from you. Amazon puts a spin on this that you should be aware of.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If people have never heard of you then it\u2019s going to be harder to get people to buy from you. This is difficult to do when you only have a listing to do this with. If you are the only person selling a red dog bowl, it\u2019s less important. However, you won\u2019t likely remain the only one. If there is any sort of competition, you will need to work on your brand marketing off Amazon. You will need to have a website. You need a social media presence and you will want to get YouTube videos up.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step is getting people to like your product. It is possible to accomplish this entirely on Amazon. You must have great looking pictures and amazing packaging. No longer can you get away with putting dreadful products on Amazon and sell it. You really must make sure that you have a good quality product.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last element is trust. If you\u2019re going to sell dog food, and make some big claim that it\u2019s going to make your dog live five years longer, then you need to back that up. Be careful on how to try to backup these claims. Amazon supplement sellers were leveraging the trust people had in Dr. Oz after he claimed vitamin c serum was the next big miracle drug. Soon these sellers started getting cease and desist letters from his lawyers. If you\u2019re going to reference an expert, be sure you have their permission to do so. A long-term strategy might involve referencing celebrities and big names in your industry and paying them for permission to use them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Using this Principle on Amazon<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s bring it back to the simplest stick: how to I make my listing more likely to convert? KLT. The know part is a long-term strategy. If you are around for a long time, keep showing up in Amazon results, dominate a niche, then you gradually become known to people and they start searching for your brand name. That is when you know that you\u2019re starting to build a brand. When you\u2019re sticking in people\u2019s minds to the point they search you out specifically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get people to like you, you have to have a remarkable product. Since you, likely, aren\u2019t well-known, your images and packaging have to look simply stunning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust is much harder to build, but you are leveraging Amazon&#8217;s trust. Which isn\u2019t the same as your consumers trusting you or your brand. If it\u2019s on Amazon, and it has good reviews, you are leveraging the trust generated by other consumers in their reviews, and the general trust people have in the Amazon platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This principle of marketing is harder to implement on Amazon, but it is vital to understand it you are wanting to build a business and if you are planning to sell that business. The more of a brand value it has, the more differentiation it has from any rivals, the greater multiples you can get when you go to sell. That could be the difference between selling your business for 2x your profits versus 3x. This is when you get the payoff for all the hard work you put in now.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-Term Strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to emphasize that this is not an instant win situation. You will get quick wins with higher conversion, the real payout shows itself long-term with a strong independent business. There are plenty of tricks you can use to circumvent the system, but Amazon is quick to fix that and then you are left with nothing. What I am teaching you today is a tried and true marketing principle that has stood the test of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are serious about moving your business forward, there are still spaces left for the December meeting of the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/mastermind\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazing FBA mastermind<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in London. In January I will be expanding to include a high-level mastermind for those that are serious about creating a strong business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Watch How KLT Can Win You Customers Again and Again<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>[video_page_section type=&#8221;youtube&#8221; position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; image=&#8221;&#8221; btn=&#8221;light&#8221; heading=&#8221;&#8221; subheading=&#8221;&#8221; cta=&#8221;&#8221; video_width=&#8221;1080&#8243; hide_related=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_logo=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_controls=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_title=&#8221;false&#8221; hide_fullscreen=&#8221;false&#8221;]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZLfTKHJrBiQ&#038;feature=youtu.be[\/video_page_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F125_How_KLT_Can_Win_You_Customers_Again_and_Again.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F125-klt-can-win-you-customers%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/125_How_KLT_Can_Win_You_Customers_Again_and_Again.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=1186-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/125_How_KLT_Can_Win_You_Customers_Again_and_Again.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"125_How_KLT_Can_Win_You_Customers_Again_and_Again.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 20:10 &#8212; 16.5MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 20:10 &#8212; 16.5MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSSToday I am bringing you another episode on marketing fundamentals: KLT.
