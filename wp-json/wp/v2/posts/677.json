What things to people go wrong on and how can they go right?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Promotion services<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of great services out there to handle promotions, but one major mistake is failing to calculate the cost of those promotions. It might sound like a great idea to give away another 10 units until you factor in the cost of that. It\u2019s important to get those numbers in front of you because that is a lot of money.<\/p>\n<p>Weigh your reasoning for doing that. Is it important to show Amazon that continued sales velocity? Do you want to hit 1000 reviews? Is that really important? For Ryan, he has goals outside of Hello Profit and Amazon. He wants to help others. By taking a look at his numbers and not just throwing money away to be the big seller, it helps him reach those goals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conversion Rates<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a very important element of selling on Amazon that is underrated and not talked about so much. Ryan was talking with another seller that had been working with Amazon for about a year that didn\u2019t know what unit session percentage was or where to find it.<\/p>\n<p>What this is, is the ratio of people that visit your page (<em><strong>sessions<\/strong><\/em>) to the number of <em><strong>units<\/strong> <\/em>that those people \u00a0purchase (<strong><em>unit session percentage<\/em>)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This number is very important to Amazon. Amazon has very limited amount of space to devote to ads and they spend actual money on you promoting products on Facebook and other places.<\/p>\n<p>So it\u2019s in their best interest to promote products that will convert. So will they choose product A that maybe 1 out of 5 times someone that visits that page, will buy the product. Or, product B that gets 1 sale out of 10? Amazon wants the higher converting product because that means they will make more money of the sales.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever Ryan got his unit\u00a0session percentage up, he noticed a lot more traffic to his ASIN because Amazon started promoting that product more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is there a magic number of conversion percentage we should hit?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There probably isn\u2019t a magic number but Ryan suspects that it varies by category. For instance, in beauty, shoppers will more likely comparison shop. So they will look at several different items before choosing, therefore conversion rates will be lower. Unlike hammers which shoppers will likely buy the first one they come to.<\/p>\n<p>On a side note, Ryan was getting around 30% in home improvement, which is really good. Sometimes up to 40%. However, if you\u2019re getting 20%, that\u2019s still very good. If you\u2019re in the teens, still probably above average. However, if you\u2019re below 10%, it\u2019s probably a sign there is an issue with your listing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With unit session percentage, is it important to differentiate between units per session or orders per session? For instance, if someone buys 10 units in a single order, that gives 10 units for one order<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>It seems to be units per session that matters. So if you sell 10 units in a single order, it\u2019s 100% order session percentage, \u00a0but it\u2019s it\u2019s 1000% unit session percentage.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unit sales that seem to drive Amazon. If\u00a0Amazon can send an ad and get 2 units sold instead of 1, they get that 15% commision twice for the same ad. It is definitely in their interest to promote that product, so focus on <strong><em>units per session<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Refunds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Refunds often denote returns, and returns are not your friend. You will get listings, and even accounts, shut down if you have too high \u00a0a return rate.<\/p>\n<p>Hello Profit has recently started tracking your refunds for you right on your merchant and product dashboard so you can see your rate of refund.<\/p>\n<p>Now you can see if you are having a lot of refunds and can do something about it; check your customer feedback, reach out to them, interrupt that process somehow and contact the customer first instead of Amazon and give them their money back.<\/p>\n<p>[When I had a product where a customer wasn\u2019t happy, I contacted them and apologized. Refunded their money and let them keep the product. Now, that product probably had a 5-6% return rate, but Amazon showed less than 1% because instead of putting &#8220;Faulty product\u00a0&#8221; or whatever that option is called,, \u00a0as the reason for refund, I put &#8220;General adjustment&#8221;, which really means nothing]<\/p>\n<p>Ryan brought up an example of his experience going the other way. He had a listing taken down because of returns. Once that happens, they start doing an investigation into your inventory which can take weeks. This is just as bad, if not worse than running out of inventory.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Customer order information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hello Profit has not gotten into the automated email append world but it\u2019s easy to find services for that, but HP makes it easy for you to do that on your own.<\/p>\n<p>In HP you can pull up your entire customer list with all the information. You get the customer\u2019s name, their real mailing address, and their phone number, and you can take that data to get their real email address.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s amazing what you can do with this. For example, you can look up which customers used a particular coupon code, get their email addresses and add them to Facebook as a custom audience. Then you can drive them to your ad. They\u2019ll see recognize your product which will legitimize your company to them. Then when they click on it you can direct them to another item, or to review that item or anything.<\/p>\n<p>This is data you can\u2019t get directly from Amazon. You can download your order data from Amazon but it doesn\u2019t give you the phone numbers, so you can use an email append service to find the real email. What you can do, and this is free, is download the customers that used a coupon code. You can get their Amazon encrypted email and write them that way and ask for a review.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>What some of Ryan\u2019s customers have done with this data, is look at seasonal items and find that they are very geographically located. The ASIN is very hot in Texas, California, and Florida. Then, they can go on Google and target those locations only and make a killing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What top software tools do you use for Amazon selling?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/helloprofit.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hello Profit<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/affiliate.junglescout.com\/idevaffiliate.php?id=945_2\">Jungle Scout<\/a>\u00a0(affiliate link)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/onlinesalesstepbystep.com\/reinstated\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cynthia Sti<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ne &#8211; She helped Ryan get his account back up when they were shut down for image non-compliance.

Empower others so you don\u2019t have to micromanage, and you can focus on growing your company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What trends do you see happening on Amazon over the next 18 months?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was listening to the co\u00adcreator of the Amazon marketplace and he was fielding this question about whether Amazon was just taking over the private label space. The bottom line is Amazon is going to keep growing and the marketplace, the third\u00adparty sellers, just does too well for Amazon to just take it over directly.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re essentially Jeff Bezos&#8217;s VAs. We\u2019re doing the hard work to make Amazon grow into the biggest most well\u00ad-rounded inventory that the world has ever seen. Amazon is too large to be able to focus on a single product the way third party sellers can.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS PODCAST<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A podcast is a free downloadable audio show that enables you to learn while you\u2019re on the go.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>To subscribe to my podcast for free, you\u2019ll need an app to listen to the show from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For iPhone\/iPad\/iPod listeners \u2013 Grab your phone or device and go to the iTunes store and search \u201cAmazing FBA\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will help you to download the free Podcasts App (produced by Apple) and then subscribe to the show from within that app.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Every time I produce a new episode, you\u2019ll get it downloaded right away. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For podcast enthusiasts \u2013 If you already listen to podcasts and have a podcatcher that you prefer, the feed you\u2019ll need to add is: http:\/\/ amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For those who don\u2019t have a mobile device \u2013 You can always listen to the show by clicking the audio file at the top of this page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have any queries, just go to www.amazingfba.com\/ask<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2F_67_Ryan_Bredemeyer_pt2-auphonic.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2F67-ryan-bredemeyer-of-hello-profit-part-2%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_67_Ryan_Bredemeyer_pt2-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=677-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/_67_Ryan_Bredemeyer_pt2-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"_67_Ryan_Bredemeyer_pt2-auphonic.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 30:58 &#8212; 28.4MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 30:58 &#8212; 28.4MB)Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSS What are the other numbers people make mistakes on?
