I\u2019ve set up my own Amazon mastermind myself, as I mentioned earlier.<br \/>\nHere\u2019s the thing &#8211; it\u2019s <b><i>really <\/i><\/b>hard work. If I were just selling on Amazon, rather than also running a podcast and coaching, I simply wouldn\u2019t do it all again. I\u2019d just plug into an existing group. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But, if you want to create something from scratch, I can give you a ton of reality checks form from personal experience:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Finding new Amazon seller peers for your Amazon mastermind<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Firstly, and most importantly, you\u2019ve got to gather together a set of people who are worth being peers with in an Amazon group in the first place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When I first started out on Amazon, and formed my own peer group of Amazon sellers, I looked through the Facebook group of a course that I was in, and searched for people who lived in or near me (in London). I then tried to check out what they had been posting, to see how active they were, whether they were moving forward with the process, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">That took a lot of time and effort.

They\u2019ve often been pitched into the idea that they can easily replace the day job within 3 months (if that\u2019s you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sure, it happens- but it\u2019s pretty rare. Sorry to burst your balloon. It\u2019s not a business-like attitude. It\u2019s based on hope. Which, as we all know, is not a strategy\u2026).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">What I\u2019ve just described sounds, in fact, like a typical Facebook group of Amazon wannapreneurs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Which is why my first effort to create a little Amazon mastermind faltered. I had found a bunch of would-be Amazon sellers who lived in London and posted a bit online. Not surprisingly, most of them proved to be very much non-action-takers, and the meetings ended up being people <i>fantasising<\/i> about starting a business, instead of <i>doing <\/i>it!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Filtering out the tyre-kickers<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">What you need is a filtering system. And, guess what, that takes time and effort to build. What I do these days for the <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/private-label-mastermind-zero-to-hero\/\"><span class=\"s2\">masterminds for Amazon sellers<\/span><\/a> that I run (through Amazing FBA) is have an application process for each Amazon mastermind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> I ask every single applicant to fill in a form with questions that I\u2019ve honed over a year of working this process. Then in some cases (all cases, for applicants to my <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/10k-collective-membership-application\"><span class=\"s2\">$10K Collective<\/span><\/a> Amazon mastermind ), I have a 20-30 minute interview in which I ask detailed questions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Why bother? Well, see above. What happens to you if you create (with some effort) a peer group of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>under-capitalized, time-poor un-focussed people? Oh yeah\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Finding people to put through your filter<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, if you are going to filter people out, you need a way of finding possible people in the first place. If you\u2019re going to manually do that, you need to be going to a lot of physical meet ups and other big groups. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s great, but there aren\u2019t a whole lot of good ones in the UK. There\u2019s a fantastic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Amazon-Sellers-London\/members\/\">Amazon meetup in London<\/a> once a month, run by the excellent Andy Geldman of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webretailer.com\/\">Webretailer<\/a>. Then there are various other meet up groups, some of which might be good, but many of which, I suspect, are run by wannabes not business owners. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"3475\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/amazon-mastermind-why\/hipster-business-meeting-rrom-interior-2591367_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/hipster-business-meeting-rrom-interior-2591367_640.jpg?fit=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Amazon mastermind meeting venue\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/hipster-business-meeting-rrom-interior-2591367_640.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/hipster-business-meeting-rrom-interior-2591367_640.jpg?fit=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3475\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/hipster-business-meeting-rrom-interior-2591367_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Amazon mastermind meeting venue\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/hipster-business-meeting-rrom-interior-2591367_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/hipster-business-meeting-rrom-interior-2591367_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Finding an Amazon mastermind meeting venue<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you\u2019ve gathered your troops, you\u2019ve got to find a suitable venue for your Amazon meet up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Firstly, it needs to be reasonably accessible for your members. So the geography and transport links matter. Then it needs to be affordable (money is whole other issue we\u2019ll discuss). This all takes quite a bit of time and effort. Even in London, I found it took hours, and we have a ton of business meeting venues in this place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You need a space that enables you all to think clearly. You could use your own house, of course, if you have the space- and the headspace. But do you really want \u00a0the kids -or your husband\/wife-interrupting a crucial business point? How conducive to clear thinking is that? It\u2019s cheap but brings its own issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You could use a local pub but I\u2019ve found (having been in an Amazon mastermind in the past who met in one) that the noise seriously disrupts your ability to hear crucial bits of information. So I can\u2019t recommend that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A quiet cafe is better &#8211; but although I find that works great for one-to-one meetings, it\u2019s not really the right way for a group of people to work, as they have to basically take over the room to do it. And there\u2019s always a screaming infant somewhere (and why should there not be? it\u2019s a cafe!)<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\">\u00a0Venue resources<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You need decent wifi of course (although I think it\u2019s less important than most people make it. But you shouldn\u2019t spend your whole time online. You need to think clearly. Online is not the place for that). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I think a whiteboard or an easel with a flipchart is very, very helpful for brainstorming strategies, or capturing key resources (eg websites or online tools) for the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Coffee on tap is great -free, good coffee even better! Easily available toilets are a mundane but crucial part of a good venue. And finally, you ideally want somewhere easy for new members to find, not a cramped room hidden upstairs behind a noisy pub!<\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"3476\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/amazon-mastermind-why\/learn-64058_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/learn-64058_640.jpg?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"learn-64058_640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/learn-64058_640.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/learn-64058_640.jpg?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3476\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/learn-64058_640-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225\" alt=\"Why choose an existing Amazon mastermind\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/learn-64058_640.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/learn-64058_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Conclusions &#8211; a reality-check on creating your own Amazon mastermind<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I hope that the above experiences save you wasting months of hard work. Frankly, now I know from experience what I know, if I were just selling on Amazon, rather than also running a podcast and coaching, I simply wouldn\u2019t do it all again. I\u2019d just plug into an existing group. As indeed I did myself about 18 months ago!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The only reason I go to all the trouble it takes to create and run a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/private-label-mastermind-zero-to-hero\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Amazon mastermind<\/span><\/a> (which I detailed just <i>some <\/i>of above), is that it\u2019s part of my mission at Amazing FBA. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">That mission is to help Amazon sellers and those in the process of establishing their own Amazon businesses to achieve REAL goals. Not just fantasies. And not to take 12 months on something that you could achieve in 3 months (or even 2) with some guidance from experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Even then, I couldn\u2019t justify the time it takes away from my Amazon business if I didn\u2019t charge a certain amount for all the efforts. The cost is pretty modest, by the way, if you compare it to the literally \u00a3thousands I\u2019ve seen some Amazon trainers charge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Often they turn out to be not true small group masterminds, but actually groups of 30-60 people. There\u2019s nothing wrong with paying \u00a310s of thousands if you get value in the \u00a3100s of thousands, but I\u2019m pretty suspicious of the value most of those so-called \u201cAmazon masterminds\u201d can really deliver.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The &#8220;Amazing FBA&#8221; Amazon Mastermind<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">So, I guess that brings me fairly unavoidably to mention the <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/private-label-mastermind-zero-to-hero\/\">Amazon masterminds<\/a> that I run for Amazing FBA. Again, I don\u2019t want to be self-serving, but it would be a bit strange for me not to mention them in the context of Amazon masterminds and \u00a0masterminds as a whole. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I try to practise what I preach, basically. I said at the start of this article that I believe that a mastermind needs to be <b>interactive<\/b>; needs to be <b>focussed<\/b>; and needs to lead its members to <b>action, <\/b>which leads to their <b>progress.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The secret sauce to a successful Amazon mastermind<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">From the (sometimes painful) experience of trying many approaches in Amazon masterminds (both as a member and group leader), I\u2019ve found the formula to combine all those good things. Like a lot of good formulas, it\u2019s pretty simple. In fact, that\u2019s partly why it\u2019s so effective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The secret sauce that I\u2019ve found to combine all those outcomes, is the <b>\u201cHot Seat\u201d. <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019ve found that to be so effective that we\u2019ve made it the overwhelming focus of each Amazon mastermind meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"3477\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/amazon-mastermind-why\/office-leather-swivel-chair-2421605_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/office-leather-swivel-chair-2421605_640.png?fit=453%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"453,640\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"office leather swivel chair-2421605_640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/office-leather-swivel-chair-2421605_640.png?fit=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/office-leather-swivel-chair-2421605_640.png?fit=453%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3477\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/office-leather-swivel-chair-2421605_640-212x300.png?resize=212%2C300\" alt=\"Amazon mastermind hot seat\" width=\"212\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/office-leather-swivel-chair-2421605_640.png?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/office-leather-swivel-chair-2421605_640.png?w=453&amp;ssl=1 453w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>The Hot Seat Secret<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Here\u2019s how it works: <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Each participant gets minimum 30 minutes to focus on their own business. Specifically, to focus on ONE thing. Even more exactly, the ONE roadblock that when they break through it, it will really move the needle. Will really move their business on -substantially.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">So it\u2019s very <b>focussed. <\/b>That\u2019s one secret. It\u2019s also <b>interactive<\/b>. Because once the member in the hot seat has outlined their issue, all other members are there to bring their experience and thoughts to the issue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, it\u2019s very helpful if the other members who <i>don\u2019t <\/i>have anything valuable to bring can keep schtum. That way, \u00a0others who <i>do <\/i>bring value can help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But it is excellent business training to encounter business problems and brainstorm solutions. That is the <i>real <\/i>training we all need as business builders. Not an obsession with the latest trick or grey hat technique (useful as they are, of course). But business <i>thinking <\/i>and <i>mindset. <\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">There is a huge bonus of having a genuine peer group in an Amazon mastermind. A lot of the people in the group share the same set of problems. So by listening to solutions to another person\u2019s problem, you\u2019re hearing the solutions to many problems of your own. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Win-win.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Implementation is the ultimate test of any Amazon mastermind<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">SO, the group members\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">can almost not fail to <b>move their business forward. <\/b>P<\/span><span class=\"s1\">rovided the participants go away and <b>implement <\/b>this stuff (another crucial word), they <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Job done! Isn\u2019t it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Well, almost. The implementation piece has proved to be a real challenge for many Amazon mastermind members.

The aim? Simple. To make sure people are implementing what they\u2019ve said they would. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s early days, but the results already look promising. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s fairly obvious where I\u2019m going with this, so I\u2019ll just come out and say it: <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">-if you\u2019re convinced of the value of being in an Amazon mastermind<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">-if you\u2019re not wanting to go through the pain, time &amp; effort of creating your own Amazon mastermind, <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">-AND if you live near London (or can get there)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">then obviously I think you should consider the Amazing FBA masterminds!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m not going to make a huge pitch for them here; if you want to check them out, there are now two levels: <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/private-label-mastermind-zero-to-hero\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Zero to Hero Mastermind<\/span><\/a>, which is geared to those who have not yet launched, and to those doing just a few thousand $ a month (or equivalent) on Amazon (we may form a separate mastermind for the latter as it grows)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/10k-collective-membership-application\/\">The $10K Collective<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">, which is for those doing at least $10K a month on Amazon. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Conclusions about any Amazon mastermind &#8211; done properly<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The thing is this. Now, you have a process that means you<b> focus on the biggest win<\/b> in your business <i>right now. <\/i>You\u00a0can get the collective mind to break through blocks and find the <b>actions<\/b> to get that win. You \u00a0have a means to hold you to <b>do that action.\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Now you have a really powerful driver to move you forward. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Like I said,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>that may be why nearly all the successful Amazon entrepreneurs I know are part of one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Wherever you live in the world, I\u2019d encourage you to look for a <b>face-to-face <\/b>mastermind you can <b>regularly <\/b>commit to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The word <strong>commit<\/strong> is a key one here too. If you put little in, you get little out.Your peer group will massively impact your wealth and well-being. So\u00a0<strong>Choose wisely who you associate with.\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But once you\u2019ve chosen well, commit to your Amazon mastermind. The more you sweat to rearrange your schedule to get to meetings; spend money on trains or planes to get there; in short, the more you put in- the more you get out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\nI can give you a promise from my experiences as an Amazon seller and from running groups. The rewards of a really quality Amazon mastermind are truly many times greater than the effort.
