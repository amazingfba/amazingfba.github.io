\/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1798\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brian Johnson of\u00a0Sponsored Products Academy<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we have Brian Johnson of <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/spa\">Sponsored Product Academy<\/a>\u00a0(&amp; PPC Scope)\u00a0to talk to us about PPC and the REAL reason for the \u00a0end of Amazon incentivized reviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is a guy that has been in\u00a0ecommerce industry for years. He started out selling banking equipment on eBay for seven years before a friend pulled him into Amazon. He began launching his own private label products. This was about three years ago when Amazing Selling Machine launched.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon after that he got in touch with a large company that was struggling on the Amazon platform and needed help. Brian slowly shifted into doing more consulting work once he saw the demand there. He found that the greatest need came down to visibility. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He needed to do more marketing which meant Pay-per-click Amazon ads. Once he began researching Amazon PPC, he found that there simply wasn\u2019t enough information out there. He decided he had to teach himself. Like many entrepreneurs, his success came about solving the problems he faced.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">End of Amazon Incentivized Reviews<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In October of 2016, Amazon announced the end of Amazon incentivized reviews. Sellers could no longer give products away in exchanged for a review. This was a major change because, until that point, incentivized reviews was the biggest ways for Amazon sellers to launch new products. In their press release, Amazon cited the reasons as wanting to improve the user experience. Which makes sense because so many reviews were fake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This started a bit of a frenzy among Amazon sellers. No one really knew where to go from there. It soon became clear that the best way forward was to focus on Amazon PPC. Sellers began to turn their attention, and their sole attention, to Amazon ads in order to drive traffic. It didn\u2019t take long for Amazon PPC costs to begin to rise. Brian did some research and realized that the cost increase began about a week after Amazon\u2019s announcement. It became quite clear that this was the new norm and not simply temporary spike. Amazon sellers began seeing advertising costs increased by as much as 5-10%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For Free video training from Brian, click on the video image\u00a0below:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/spa\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"1852\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/159-incentivized-reviews-brian-johnson\/social-post-2-video-placeholder-3-social\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Social-Post-2-Video-Placeholder-3-SOCIAL.jpg?fit=2000%2C1047&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1047\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Social Post #2 Video Placeholder 3 SOCIAL\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Social-Post-2-Video-Placeholder-3-SOCIAL.jpg?fit=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Social-Post-2-Video-Placeholder-3-SOCIAL.jpg?fit=1024%2C536&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1852 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Social-Post-2-Video-Placeholder-3-SOCIAL-300x157.jpg?resize=300%2C157\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Social-Post-2-Video-Placeholder-3-SOCIAL.jpg?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Social-Post-2-Video-Placeholder-3-SOCIAL.jpg?resize=768%2C402&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Social-Post-2-Video-Placeholder-3-SOCIAL.jpg?resize=1024%2C536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Social-Post-2-Video-Placeholder-3-SOCIAL.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon\u2019s Benefit<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may have not been Amazon\u2019s main intention for the end of Amazon incentivized reviews, but they did see a major increase in profit because of it. In the course of his research Brian saw that you were still able to use Amazon Vine. This is Amazon\u2019s programme for paid reviews. Instead of using a third party option, you could pay to use Amazon\u2019s program which starts at $2500 a product. Brain also found that Amazon makes a lot of money from PPC. Over a billions dollars a year. With PPC costs rising by 5-10%, that\u2019s a lot of money Amazon made by eliminating Amazon incentivized reviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Sell in a Post-Incentivized Review World<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t want to get swept up in the Amazon PPC craze. Everyone is moving to PPC, they are flooding the market, and driving up costs. You need to figure out how to sell in a 2017 Amazon. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"1849\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/159-incentivized-reviews-brian-johnson\/checklist-1919292_640\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/checklist-1919292_640.jpg?fit=546%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"546,640\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"checklist-1919292_640\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/checklist-1919292_640.jpg?fit=256%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/checklist-1919292_640.jpg?fit=546%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1849 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/checklist-1919292_640-256x300.jpg?resize=256%2C300\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/checklist-1919292_640.jpg?resize=256%2C300&amp;ssl=1 256w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/amazingfba.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/checklist-1919292_640.jpg?w=546&amp;ssl=1 546w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t Do List<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t listen to seller support. One of the biggest mistakes Brian is seeing is following the wrong advice. They call up Seller Support which tells them to run one campaign and increase their bid. These reps are not trained property and they simply give bad advice. They don\u2019t understand how the platform works. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This works well for Amazon. They make more money and can quickly clear out their support tickets. It doesn\u2019t work well for sellers that can afford to waste a lot of money by throwing it away in Amazon ads. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/spa\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click here for video training on this<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Practices<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon PPC is a complex system. There is not one size fits all. Each product is different. They have different customers, different click through rates, so you have to run a solid PPC campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not only does Amazon look at your products, but they also look at the customers. Sometimes they will show your ads to audiences that are related to your products. These tend to be very inefficient. It used to be that you could just run negative keywords and block the search terms from displaying you ads. Now you have to be more hands-on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Amazon Audience<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sellers we tend to be lazy when it comes to our Amazon audience of shoppers. Amazon does such a great job of bring the correct shoppers to us, that we tend to focus solely on the products rather than who is buying our products. This is a mental shift that we all must make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing we do as sellers during product research is that we focus on what our competitors are doing and misinterpret why they are successful. We see that they have a keyword in the title and assume they are doing well because of that. That is ignoring the fact that every product is selling based on dozens of different keywords. No product\u00a0will rank for just one keyword.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have to do a better job understanding our audience, and the search terminology that brings them to our products. We spend all this time focusing on one keyword, and then learn, through PPC, that it\u2019s not a converting keyword for our product. PPC is a great marketing <em><strong>research<\/strong><\/em> tool we have to use. It\u2019s the best way of determining who the audience is, and what converts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaign Structure<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proper campaign structure will give your product individual exposure to an audience. One thing to ensure is to never lump together several products in one ad group. Separating them out will\u00a0allow you to determine, according to the Amazon reports, who the audience is for each product, rather than a group of products. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing to keep in mind is that Amazon sponsored ads don\u2019t necessarily behave in a logical manner, especially if you\u2019re coming from Google Adwords. Adwords has more options to fine-tune your ad. Much more than the four we have on Amazon (which include broad, phrase and exact match). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The logical idea is to start broad with your ads, and narrow down to an exact match. It\u2019s logical to think that you\u2019ll have better conversion rates. That\u2019s how it works with Google Adwords. That tactic doesn\u2019t always work with sponsored products because Amazon has all the buyer data. This allows them to show ads in different situations based on the buyer\u2019s shopping history. You can\u2019t just throw your keywords into exact and be done. You have to test in all match types so you can find which keywords work for which match type for your product.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword Testing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are good way of testing, and bad ways of testing. The important thing to remember is that you have to test. Even if the test go against conventional wisdom. You won\u2019t know for sure until you test it. One mistake sellers often make is splitting their match types into different campaigns. They will have exact match as a different campaign than their phrase match. It reduces the efficiency of the PPC algorithm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For 4\u00a0free videos with Brian, click the link below:<a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/spa\"><br \/>\n<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/spa\">Free training<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sponsored vs Organic Listing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One super important point: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>There is a different algorithm for sponsored positioning than for organic positioning.<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So a classic mistake\u00a0is taking what works for organic results, and using them with sponsored. Organic results ranking rely heavily on relative conversion rates &#8211; how many units are you selling compared to other product in the niche. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sponsored ads rely much more on how the advertising campaign performs and its ability to bring customers into a product listing. Amazon is looking for people to click on the ads which you then pay for and Amazon makes money. So Amazon rewards your campaign with better positioning, if it generates more clicks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is all about the customer experience. The worst thing for Amazon is to have customers get confused, not find what they\u2019re looking for, and leave the site without buying anything. The best thing is to show the customer what they&#8217;re looking for as quickly as possible, which leads to higher close rates. The better we are at advertising our own products and getting the customer to click on our ads, the more likely the customer is to convert.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many reasons why Amazon might not even show your ad. On top of that, Amazon\u2019s algorithm determines whether or not they will consider showing your ad. If they don\u2019t, if you are filtered out, it\u2019s usually due to one of two things:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first one: the product doesn\u2019t qualify. Maybe it doesn\u2019t have the buy box, or it\u2019s not allowed to run ads, or it\u2019s not allowed to run ads on a specific keyword (for example trademarked terms like &#8220;Nike&#8221;).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The second pass\/fail is relevance. Is the product in a sub-category that is relevant to the search term?
