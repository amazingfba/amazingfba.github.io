Tune in to see what he had to say about upselling to your customers and using different strategies <\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">to teach us how to sell products online.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">For our other interview or access to a webinar Dana present, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/dana\">http:\/\/amazingfba.com\/dana<\/a>.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">Create an amazing offer<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">An amazing offer would be discounting your product by 50% because most sellers are only just discounting 5 <\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">or <\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">maybe 10%. Where 50% off is definitely is a big deal to most customers and they will love you for it. Especially if you can show that it is actually selling at that price on Amazon. Getting 50% off would be the best way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sellerapp.com\/help\/article\/amazon-product-promotion\/\">create a<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sellerapp.com\/help\/article\/amazon-product-promotion\/\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">n<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sellerapp.com\/help\/article\/amazon-product-promotion\/\"> awesome offer<\/a>.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">Presenting your discount<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">You should give the customer a coupon inside with the package. When they get to Amazon and get to the right link they will find the product is at full price. To make sure the customer uses their coupon you would charge full price. Then at purchase when they use their coupon that would basically <a href=\"http:\/\/www.salesbacker.com\/blog\/166\/How_to_Create_Amazon_Coupons_in_Seller_Central\">unlock the 50% off making the product cheaper<\/a>.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">Percentages and numbers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">You come out ahead when you sell at a discounted price because you don&#8217;t have the fee that you would at full price, and most importantly you get a customer off of Amazon. The thing to remember is getting customers off of Amazon is value in and of itself. As far as percentages go your range should be between 5 to 20%. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The thing that is most exciting is once you get your backend build up really well, and you can take customers off of Amazon. Suddenly you don&#8217;t have to try and make your money solely off of Amazon. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Another tactic to making big money is to take an existing product and lower your prices that way you can get more people coming through your door, and potentially making a purchase. Combining this tactic with offering coupons is the best way of getting more eyeballs on your product. You&#8217;ll get more buys and outsmart your competitors.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">How to Sell Products Online<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Physical products businesses are cool. Some of the people don&#8217;t talk about how much money they require to grow and scale them. because every time you sell out of inventory you need twice as much the next time. The best thing to do is to inject product services into what you&#8217;re already selling. One of the things you could do on the front end would be to inject informational products like <\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">a<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> how-to.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The next step is to <a href=\"https:\/\/affiliate-program.amazon.com\/\">become an affiliate<\/a> for some of the products people are buying from you. The thinking of most people is that their next dollar only comes from launching their next product. But it is much more important to build it up from front-end to back-end first. Once you have done that just rinse and repeat which is much more important than injecting a new product.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">The 80\/20 Principle<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">A great book to read on this principle is written by Perry Marshall on how to sell products online. You&#8217;ll find the that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/callyrussell\/2019\/05\/27\/amazon-redefining-the-8020-rule\/#2fea0e9d6d09\">80% of your revenues come from 20% of your fulfillment<\/a>. So, when you get higher up offers you&#8217;re actually spending less time and money, but you making more doing it. Any listeners out there that do not already have these high ticket offers you&#8217;re really missing out on your best customers. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">Dana\u2019s amazing book<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Dana has sold numerous copies of his book at $2,500 because the contents of the book are so valuable. Inside his book, he shows how he&#8217;s able to sell most of his books for a whopping $200,000 and even up to $400,000 per copy when other people are selling their book for only $20.00.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">He goes through the entire process of how to sell products online and making huge profits in the digital product world. The exciting part is that he is giving away a free copy to all the listeners at his own expense completely free. Stay tuned to get your free copy! Limited time only!<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"western\">Dana\u2019s Goat Farm Mastermind<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Dana\u2019s first go for the Mastermind was a couple months ago which was unbelievable and a really special event. Because it went so well the first time it will be happening again February 2018. This will be a live event. He will be personally working one-on-one with people, but he will also be having other people flying in to share with the community as well. It&#8217;s different than most masterminds because it&#8217;s at his house and there are only 20 spots available. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Goats will be involved. Doors are now open and several spots have already been taken so don&#8217;t wait too long to reserve your spot before February 2018. It is very simple to apply just by going to <\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">http:\/\/<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">goatfarmmastermind.com.
