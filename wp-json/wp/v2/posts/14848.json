Sounds like a dream, right? But what if we told you there&#8217;s a strategy that can help you achieve this \u2013 and it doesn&#8217;t involve a hefty advertising budget?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guide delves into a proven influencer marketing strategy specifically designed to create pre-launch buzz and propel your Amazon product launch to new heights. We&#8217;ll explore how to leverage the power of influencers not just at launch, but in the crucial months leading up to it. By building anticipation and fostering a sense of community, you can ensure your product hits the ground running and achieves significant sales velocity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time Stamp<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00] &#8211; Introduction to the 10K Collective Mastermind<br>[00:49] &#8211; Welcome to the podcast for Amazon sellers<br>[01:13] &#8211; Focus on using influencers for product launches<br>[01:22] &#8211; Applying influencer strategy to new product launches<br>[01:52] &#8211; Building relationships with influencers before product launch<br>[02:35] &#8211; Example of makeup brand building influencer relationships<br>[03:36] &#8211; Benefits of early influencer engagement for product launches<br>[04:13] &#8211; Comparison to film industry marketing tactics<br>[04:36] &#8211; Addressing challenges with maintaining sales after initial launch<br>[05:24] &#8211; Importance of newness in influencer marketing<br>[06:06] &#8211; Strategy for scaling influencer relationships<br>[07:27] &#8211; Analogy with scaling advertising campaigns<br>[08:43] &#8211; Discussion on affiliate deals and commissions<br>[09:40] &#8211; Explanation of the halo effect in influencer marketing<br>[11:24] &#8211; Comparison to ACOS vs TACOS in Amazon advertising<br>[12:37] &#8211; Benefits of generous affiliate commissions for Amazon brands<br>[14:38] &#8211; Strategies for working with influencers without affiliate links<br>[15:27] &#8211; The followers to customer funnel concept<br>[17:03] &#8211; Approach to paying influencers based on proven results<br>[18:44] &#8211; Efficient system for identifying effective influencers<br>[19:15] &#8211; Information on Tomer&#8217;s newsletter and resources<br>[20:06] &#8211; Overview of Tomer&#8217;s influencer marketing system<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Long Game: Start Building Relationships 6 Months Before Launch<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the secret weapon of this strategy: starting early. Don&#8217;t wait until your product is ready to ship before reaching out to influencers. Ideally, aim to connect with them at least 6 months before your launch date. Here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Emotional Connection:<\/strong> By engaging with influencers early, you allow them to become invested in your brand story. Document your product development journey and share it with them. This fosters a deeper connection and encourages them to become advocates for your brand.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Building a &#8220;Hot List&#8221; of Buyers:<\/strong> Through pre-launch influencer marketing, you can create a buzz that attracts potential customers. Encourage influencers to share snippets about your product and its development process. This creates a &#8220;hot list&#8221; of buyers who are already excited about your product before it even hits the shelves.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Study: The Power of Storytelling in Pre-Launch Buzz<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at a real-world example. Imagine a client developing a new makeup line for young girls. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the launch gets delayed by a year. However, the brand had already built relationships with over 200 relevant influencers. During the delay, they continued to share the product story and development journey with these influencers. This pre-launch buzz resulted in a phenomenal launch, proving the power of storytelling and early influencer engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Influencer Marketing vs. Ads &amp; SEO: Consistency vs. Spikes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A common concern with influencer marketing is its perceived inconsistency compared to paid advertising or SEO. While paid ads can generate a quick surge in sales, their effectiveness often diminishes over time. Similarly, SEO takes time to build long-term organic traffic. So, how does influencer marketing fit in?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key lies in understanding the limitations of your product itself. If you have a single product launch, there&#8217;s a limit to how often influencers can promote it before it becomes repetitive. However, the true power lies in:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Building a Strong Amazon Listing:<\/strong> Your product listing is the cornerstone of converting interest into sales. Optimize it with relevant keywords, high-quality images, and compelling product descriptions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Diversifying Your Influencer Network:<\/strong> Don&#8217;t rely on just one influencer to carry your launch. Partner with a network of relevant influencers with varying audiences. This broadens your reach and ensures consistent exposure throughout the pre-launch phase.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Influencer Marketing Outshines Paid Ads in the Long Run<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of paid advertising like a single well-performing keyword in your Google Ads campaign. It drives initial traffic, but you&#8217;ll eventually need to find new keywords to maintain momentum. Influencer marketing offers a more sustainable solution:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Beyond the Initial Push:<\/strong> Influencer content can have a long shelf life. A compelling product review or tutorial video can continue to attract new customers long after the initial campaign ends. This organic growth potential provides a significant advantage over paid advertising.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Building Brand Authority:<\/strong> Positive influencer endorsements build trust and credibility for your brand. This, in turn, attracts organic traffic through search engines and social media mentions, further solidifying your brand&#8217;s presence in the marketplace.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Affiliate Commissions vs. Organic Growth: A Win-Win Strategy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Affiliate marketing, where influencers earn a commission on each sale they generate, might seem like the only way to incentivize influencer promotion. However, here are some things to consider:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The &#8220;Cost of Customer Acquisition&#8221; Myth:<\/strong> Not all brands can afford high affiliate commissions, especially during the initial launch phase. However, remember Dan Sullivan&#8217;s quote: &#8220;The business who can pay the most to acquire a customer wins.&#8221; While upfront costs might seem high, the long-term customer lifetime value can significantly outweigh the initial investment. Additionally, focusing solely on affiliate commissions can have drawbacks:<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Discount Fatigue:<\/strong> An overreliance on discount codes can cheapen your brand image and lead to &#8220;discount shoppers&#8221; who are only interested in the lowest price.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Influencer Burnout:<\/strong> Bombarding audiences with constant affiliate offers can lead to influencer burnout and decreased audience engagement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s where the &#8220;Followers to Customer Funnel&#8221; approach comes in:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Track Influencer Performance:<\/strong> Utilize UTM parameters or trackable links to identify which influencers are driving the most traffic and conversions to your Amazon listing. This allows you to refine your strategy and focus on the most effective partnerships.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Authentic Engagement:<\/strong> Encourage influencers to create content that showcases the value and benefits of your product, rather than solely focusing on affiliate links. This fosters a more authentic connection with their audience and ultimately leads to higher conversion rates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Power of the &#8220;Follower to Customer Funnel&#8221; in Action<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many brands are hesitant to invest in influencer marketing without a guaranteed return on investment (ROI) in the form of affiliate commissions. Here&#8217;s a successful example that demonstrates the power of the &#8220;Follower to Customer Funnel&#8221; approach:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomer, an e-commerce entrepreneur, wanted to understand how influencer marketing truly impacted sales beyond just affiliate links. He tracked which influencers generated the most interest and awareness around his product launch. This included monitoring:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Brand Mentions:<\/strong> Tracking how often influencers mentioned his brand on their social media platforms.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engagement Metrics:<\/strong> Analyzing metrics like likes, comments, and shares on influencer posts about his product.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Traffic Sources:<\/strong> Utilizing UTM parameters to identify which influencers were driving the most traffic to his Amazon listing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing on these metrics, Tomer could identify influencers who were effectively generating interest and awareness, even if they weren&#8217;t directly driving sales through affiliate links. This allowed him to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Maintain Brand Authenticity:<\/strong> By focusing on authentic content creation, Tomer avoided bombarding audiences with discount codes and maintained trust with potential customers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Build Long-Term Relationships:<\/strong> By appreciating the value of influencers who generated genuine interest, Tomer fostered strong relationships that could be nurtured into future affiliate partnerships.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Minimizing Risk and Maximizing Results: A Step-by-Step Approach<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of how to implement the &#8220;Follower to Customer Funnel&#8221; approach and minimize upfront costs while maximizing results:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Start Small, Scale Smart:<\/strong> Begin by reaching out to a manageable group of 10-25 influencers who align with your brand and target audience. Track their content performance and audience engagement to identify the most effective partners.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Power of Free Products:<\/strong> Sending a free product to influencers allows them to experience it firsthand and create genuine content. However, avoid pressuring them to include affiliate links or specific messaging.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rewarding Performance:<\/strong> Once you&#8217;ve identified influencers who generate significant interest and awareness, consider offering them affiliate commissions or other incentives to further incentivize sales.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, building trust and fostering long-term relationships with influencers is key. By focusing on organic growth, you can establish a strong foundation for your brand and unlock the true potential of influencer marketing for your Amazon launch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Study: From Free Product to Profitable Partnership<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine an influencer who initially received your product for free and created a compelling review video. This video generated significant traffic and positive buzz for your brand. Now, seeing the results, you can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Offer an Affiliate Commission:<\/strong> Approach the influencer and offer them a competitive affiliate commission to incentivize them to include your affiliate link in future promotions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Long-Term Partnership:<\/strong> Based on their success, consider building a long-term partnership with this influencer. This could involve ongoing product collaborations, exclusive content creation, or even brand ambassador programs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By nurturing relationships and rewarding performance, you can turn initial free product placements into profitable partnerships that fuel your brand&#8217;s growth and success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Brand with Influencer Marketing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While influencer marketing might seem like a gamble, the &#8220;Follower to Customer Funnel&#8221; approach offers a low-risk, high-reward strategy for your Amazon launch. By focusing on building brand awareness, fostering trust with your audience, and establishing strong influencer relationships, you can generate pre-launch buzz and propel your product towards long-term success. Remember, influencer marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. By investing in building a strong foundation, you can unlock the true potential of this powerful marketing strategy and dominate your Amazon launch.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<!--powerpress_player--><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.blubrry.com\/?media_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2Fcontent.blubrry.com%2Famazingfba%2FEpisode_02-Make_30K_monthly_in_8_weeks_with_influencers_for_Amazon_product_launches-auphonic.mp3&amp;podcast_link=https%3A%2F%2Famazingfba.com%2Fdominate-amazon-launch-influencer-strategy%2F#mode-Light&border-000000&progress-000000\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"165\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"blubrryplayer-3\" class=\"blubrryplayer\" title=\"Blubrry Podcast Player\"><\/iframe><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1px !important;\">Podcast: <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/Episode_02-Make_30K_monthly_in_8_weeks_with_influencers_for_Amazon_product_launches-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/?powerpress_pinw=14848-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/content.blubrry.com\/amazingfba\/Episode_02-Make_30K_monthly_in_8_weeks_with_influencers_for_Amazon_product_launches-auphonic.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"Episode_02-Make_30K_monthly_in_8_weeks_with_influencers_for_Amazon_product_launches-auphonic.mp3\">Download<\/a> (Duration: 24:03 &#8212; 22.0MB)<\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/32Cryk51sxVlF03B38UeoJ\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_spotify\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe on Spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/subscribebyemail.com\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe by Email\" rel=\"nofollow\">Email<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/amazingfba.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p><p>Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 24:03 &#8212; 22.0MB) Subscribe: Spotify | Email | RSS Imagine launching your amazon product launch that&#8217;s brand new and achieving explosive sales within a short timeframe.
