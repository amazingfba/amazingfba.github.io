Kody Thompson, founder of WrkPod, isn't your average entrepreneur. He bootstrapped a web development company from a shoestring budget into a multi-million dollar powerhouse, generating over $5 million in profit. One of his biggest success factors? Building a high-performing team in the Philippines.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This guide delves into Kody's journey, exploring how he leveraged Filipino talent to achieve explosive growth. We'll uncover his recruitment strategies, team management philosophies, and the key benefits of outsourcing for ecommerce businesses.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
From Freelance Hustle to Global Success: The Power of Outsourcing<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kody's story begins like many others â€“ a freelance graphic designer trading time for money. But Kody recognized the limitations of this approach. "I wasn't getting paid when I was doing bookkeeping or social media," he explains. "My value lies in design."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This realization sparked a pivotal shift. Kody started outsourcing administrative tasks, freeing him to focus on his core skills. This newfound efficiency fueled the growth of his web development company, propelling his annual revenue to a staggering $700,000 with a team of just 5-6 Filipino virtual assistants.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Building a Dream Team: Beyond Remote Work<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While outsourcing tasks proved beneficial, Kody realized the limitations of a fully remote team. Managing talent spread across different locations posed challenges. The solution? Building a centralized team in the Philippines.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But where to start? Kody identified Dumaguete City, home to top universities brimming with tech talent. He secured office space near the university, forging partnerships with deans and establishing an internship program. This provided direct access to top students, many of whom transitioned into full-time positions after graduation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finding the Right Talent: Avoiding Common Mistakes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Outsourcing success hinges on finding and retaining skilled personnel. Kody highlights some of the most common pitfalls:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Assuming everyone learns like you: Different people learn in different ways. Tailor your training methods to ensure effective skills transfer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Adaptability: Resistance to change is a common obstacle. Foster a culture that embraces evolution and continuous improvement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Unreliable Payment: Not paying staff on time is a recipe for disaster. Develop a robust payroll system and prioritize on-time salary payments.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Building Your Foundation: From Passion Project to Scalable Business<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many ecommerce ventures begin as passion projects. Kody initially offered freelance graphic design services to support his volunteer work. However, his vision evolved. Recognizing the limitations of selling time for money, he pivoted towards a subscription-based web development model.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The "Aha" Moment: Identifying a Lucrative Niche &amp; Building Recurring Revenue<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kody's turning point came when he realized the high cost of custom websites deterred small businesses. He observed a need within the fitness industry and pivoted again, creating website templates specifically tailored for gyms. This niche focus, combined with a subscription model, ensured recurring revenue and a scalable business.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Building a Business That Runs Without You: Systems, Documentation, and Delegation<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Building to sell requires a business independent of your personal involvement. Kody achieved this by:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Systematizing processes: Creating clear workflows for all aspects of the business.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Detailed documentation: Documenting procedures for future reference and team training.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Clean financials: Maintaining accurate and up-to-date financial records.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Daily bookkeeping: Ensuring financial transparency for potential buyers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Power of Team: Building a Culture of Excellence<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A strong team is fundamental to a thriving ecommerce business. Kody prioritized building a team he enjoyed working with, fostering a positive work environment. This translates into higher employee retention and a more attractive business proposition for potential buyers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Exit Strategy: Setting the Stage for a Lucrative Sale<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many entrepreneurs underestimate the importance of planning for an exit from the start. Here's why Kody built with the goal of selling:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Reduced reliance on personal time: A successful business generates revenue regardless of your daily involvement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Reliable, recurring revenue: Predictable income stream attracts higher valuations from potential buyers.<br />
<br />
<br />

[00:23:21] Summary of Levanta's Role in Automating Affiliate Program Management and Information<br />
The 3-Pronged Approach to Affiliate Recruitment:<br />
<br />
<br />
 	<br />
Network Advantage: Leverage established platforms like Levanta to access a pre-vetted pool of affiliates. Filter by audience size, niche, and engagement to find your perfect match. Remember, personalization trumps mass blasts! Be flexible with commission rates and consider product gifts for influencers.<br />
<br />
 	<br />
Beyond the Network: Don't limit yourself! Actively seek out affiliates through external marketing. Use discovery tools, personalize your outreach (DMs, LinkedIn, emails), and track your efforts. Levanta offers a branded signup link, streamlining the onboarding process for your recruits.<br />
<br />
 	<br />
Make it Visible: Place your affiliate signup link prominently across your online presence. Include it on your DTC website, social media profiles, and even Amazon listing descriptions. Accessibility is key to attracting potential partners.<br />
<br />
<br />
Building Relationships, Not Just Commissions:<br />
While financial incentives are important, remember, genuine connections create long-term success. Offer exclusive deals, early access to new products, and even lifetime supply options for top performers. Go beyond CPA â€“ consider flat fees for valuable affiliates.<br />
Navigating the Amazon Affiliate Landscape:<br />
Unlike the Wild West of early internet advertising, the Amazon ecosystem offers built-in fraud protection. Focus on finding quality affiliates who align with your brand and target audience, rather than worrying about scams. Don't be afraid to work with smaller influencers â€“ their dedicated communities can offer surprising results.<br />
Levanta: Your Affiliate Management Ally:<br />
Levanta streamlines affiliate onboarding, tracking, communication, and management. Imagine automated workflows, detailed reports, and a dedicated support team, all under one roof.<br />

Understanding the Landscape: What is External Traffic and Affiliate Marketing?<br />
External traffic refers to any traffic that reaches your Amazon listings from sources outside of Amazon itself, such as social media, influencer marketing, or content websites. Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing model where you partner with third-party publishers (affiliates) who promote your products to their audiences. You only pay them a commission when they drive a sale, making it a low-risk, high-reward strategy.<br />
Why Leverage External Traffic via Affiliate Marketing?<br />
<br />
<br />
 	Boost organic ranking:Â External traffic can significantly improve your organic ranking on Amazon,Â leading to increased visibility and sales.<br />
 	De-risk your strategy:Â Unlike paid advertising,Â affiliate marketing doesn't require upfront investment.Â You only pay for results,Â minimizing potential losses.<br />
 	Tap into diverse audiences:Â Affiliates can reach niche audiences that you might not access through traditional Amazon SEO methods.<br />
 	Enjoy long-term benefits:Â The brand referral bonus program rewards you for external traffic-driven sales,Â providing additional revenue streams.<br />
<br />
Incentivizing Affiliates: The Key to Success<br />
Building a thriving affiliate program requires offering attractive incentives. This includes:<br />
<br />
<br />
 	Competitive commission rates:Â Aim for at least 10% to attract high-quality affiliates.<br />
 	Strong product-market fit:Â Ensure your products resonate with your target audience and offer real value.<br />
 	Effective marketing materials:Â Provide affiliates with high-quality product images,Â descriptions,Â and promotional materials.<br />
 	Clear tracking and reporting:Â Offer transparent tracking tools to enable affiliates to monitor their performance.<br />
<br />
Case Study: Exploding Sales with the Power of Affiliate Marketing<br />
Lockstar, an Amazon seller, saw their sales surge from $0 to $80,000 per month after launching an affiliate program on Levanta. This incredible growth demonstrates the transformative potential of external traffic and affiliate marketing.<br />
Beyond the Basics: Advanced Strategies and Resources<br />
<br />
<br />
 	Diversify your affiliate network:Â Partner with a variety of affiliates,Â including social media influencers,Â bloggers,Â and niche websites.<br />
 	Leverage deal-focused platforms:Â Utilize Facebook groups and coupon sites to reach bargain-hunting audiences.<br />
 	Track and optimize your program:Â Monitor key metrics and adjust your strategies for optimal ...]]></itunes:summary>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Understanding the European MarketplaceÂ <br />
<br />
The first step in conquering the EU market is comprehending its diverse nature. Europe is not a monolithic entity but a mosaic of unique cultures, languages, and consumer behaviors. UK sellers must abandon the notion of a homogenous European market and instead embrace a localized approach. This means tailoring products, marketing, and customer support to individual countries.<br />
<br />
Navigating VAT and ComplianceÂ <br />
<br />
VAT registration and compliance are pivotal in cross-border trade. Setting up a company in Europe, preferably in countries like the Netherlands with tax advantages, facilitates smooth VAT registration. Importantly, understanding VAT thresholds and regulations specific to each country is vital. Additionally, ensuring products comply with EU standards, including CE certification, is non-negotiable. Compliance guarantees seamless entry and avoids legal complications.<br />
<br />
Logistics: The Heartbeat of Customer ExperienceÂ <br />
<br />
Logistics is the backbone of customer experience in e-commerce. A European hub, strategically located in countries like the Netherlands, acts as a centralized point for stock control. Implementing a robust logistics network ensures efficient order fulfillment and, crucially, enables next-day deliveries, a key factor in customer satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Cracking the Code: Language and Marketing<br />
<br />
Language is the gateway to consumers' hearts. Utilizing professional native speakers for product page translations, keyword optimization, and localized marketing is indispensable. Google Translate won't cut it; authentic communication resonates with customers. Implementing effective PPC (Pay-Per-Click) campaigns, rooted in thorough keyword research, ensures visibility and drives targeted traffic. Continual monitoring and adaptation are vital to stay ahead in the competitive landscape.<br />
<br />
Strategic Partnerships: Your Secret Weapon<br />
<br />
In the intricate tapestry of EU market entry, having the right partners is a game-changer. Choosing partners adept at navigating the complexities of customs, regulations, and local markets expedites the process. These partners facilitate seamless import-export operations and handle the nuances of each country, allowing sellers to focus on core business aspects.<br />
<br />

In the ever-evolving world of e-commerce, mastering the art of Ecommerce Pricing Strategies is essential to your business's success. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting, understanding the ecommerce strategies that empower your pricing is crucial. In this article, we're going to explore three powerful principles that can significantly impact your pricing power and your ability to set prices that attract and retain customers. Are you ready to discover the secrets of e-commerce pricing? Let's dive in.<br />
Ecommerce Pricing Strategy 1: Pre-Selling for Anticipation and Trust<br />
In a world where raising prices can often lead to customer pushback, pre-selling is a strategy that can work wonders. It's like creating a magical aura around your products. Imagine being able to raise your prices, and your customers still eagerly line up to buy.<br />
<br />
Pre-selling is all about building anticipation and trust. It's the art of telegraphing your punches to your customers, letting them know what you'll offer in the future. The more anticipation and enthusiasm you can generate, the more pricing power you gain.<br />
<br />
A fantastic example of pre-selling is the launch of Elon Musk's Cybertruck. Years before it was set to be produced, Musk pre-sold the Cybertruck. People could sign up with a $1,000 deposit, even though the final price wasn't announced. The result? A massive number of customers signed up without knowing the exact cost, showcasing the power of pre-selling.<br />
<br />
So, how can you apply pre-selling to your e-commerce business? Consider these strategies:<br />
<br />
 	* Product Suites: Think in terms of creating a series of products or integrated product concepts. This allows you to stack products and generate anticipation for the entire suite.<br />
 	* Launch Strategies: Don't just release a product quietly. Create a buzz with a well-planned product launch. Engage your audience with teasers, events, and an exciting unveiling.<br />
 	* Leverage Trust: Building trust in your brand is essential. When customers trust your products, they are more likely to embrace pre-selling. Focus on delivering quality and value consistently.<br />
<br />
Ecommerce Pricing Strategy 2: The Power of Timing<br />
Timing is everything in e-commerce, and it can be a potent tool in creating pricing power. Think about seasonal products like Halloween costumes or Thanksgiving turkeys. People expect to see these items during specific times of the year, and they are willing to pay a premium for them when the time is right.<br />
<br />
Consider the timing in your niche and your product offerings. Look for opportunities to align your products with moments when demand naturally increases. Whether it's holidays, special events, or even trends, timing can give you a significant advantage in setting higher prices without customer resistance.<br />
<br />
Timing can also be about releasing your products strategically. If you have a loyal customer base, they may eagerly await your new releases. This anticipation can allow you to price your products higher during the initial launch.<br />
<br />
Remember, timing isn't just about the time of year; it's also about the moment within your customers' buying journey. Ensure you're meeting their needs and delivering value when they need it most.<br />
Ecommerce Pricing Strategy 3: Leveraging Gift Cards for Price Insensitivity<br />
Gift cards are a valuable, yet often underutilized asset for e-commerce businesses. They create a unique form of price insensitivity. When customers use gift cards, they are essentially spending someone else's money. As a result, they become less sensitive to individual item prices and more focused on the overall shopping experience.<br />
<br />
Here's how you can leverage gift cards to enhance your pricing strategy:<br />
<br />
 	* Promote Gift Cards: Encourage the purchase of gift cards during ...]]></itunes:summary>

How to Grow an Amazon Business- How Scott Needham Achieved a 50% Growth in Margins<br />
In today's blog post, we're going to delve into how to grow an Amazon business, and specifically a reseller business. Scott Needham is a seasoned Amazon seller and software developer. Scott shares invaluable insights on how he managed to scale a reseller business, increase margins from 14% to 21%, and even built a cutting-edge software tool to revolutionize the reselling game. Join us as we uncover the key strategies and lessons that can help you grow your Amazon business.<br />
The Journey to 50% Margin Growth<br />
Scott Needham's journey began in 2013 when he joined his brother's already thriving Amazon reseller business, which had accumulated millions in sales but faced challenges in scaling. The pivotal moment came when Scott harnessed technology to automate critical business processes. This automation laid the foundation for substantial growth, taking their team from just a handful of employees to a formidable workforce of 80.<br />
<br />
One of the critical components of their success was the development of custom software tools designed to streamline various aspects of the reselling process, from inventory management to order automation. These tools enabled them to efficiently scale their business, despite initial hiccups and pricing mistakes.<br />
<br />
Scott emphasizes that reselling is one of the fastest ways to grow revenue, even if the profit margins can be lower than those in private label ventures. The real secret to their impressive 50% margin growth lay in how they managed their pricing strategies using a repricer tool. They strategically adjusted their pricing based on inventory levels and competition, allowing them to maximize profits.<br />
Lessons Learned and Mistakes Made while growing an Amazon business<br />
While Scott's journey has been marked by remarkable achievements, he also candidly shares the challenges and mistakes they encountered along the way. Two key takeaways are particularly noteworthy:<br />
Winning Over Big Brands<br />
One of the significant lessons was the importance of building strong relationships with big brands. Scott acknowledges that they could have been more persuasive in their approach to convince larger brands to work with them. He believes investing in a more professional website to convey a sense of trustworthiness would have been beneficial. Simplifying their sales process and avoiding excessive Amazon-specific jargon could also have helped secure more partnerships.<br />
The Power of the Repricer<br />
Scott's second valuable lesson revolves around the repricer tool. Resellers often focus on selling at the lowest price to win the buy box, but Scott and his team adopted a different approach. They used their repricer to float their prices higher when they restocked a product, aiming for a minimum gross margin. This strategic pricing approach, combined with automation, significantly boosted their margins.<br />
Introducing Smart Scout<br />
Scott Needham's passion for technology and data analysis led him to create Smart Scout, a tool tailored for resellers. Smart Scout simplifies the process of identifying profitable products and brands on Amazon by providing a comprehensive overview of estimated revenue and in-stock rates. It allows resellers to filter and pinpoint brands that meet specific criteria, streamlining the sourcing process.<br />
<br />
Smart Scout is a powerful resource for resellers looking to uncover hidden opportunities and make data-driven decisions.

Conclusion<br />
Scott Needham's journey from a family reselling business to creating powerful software tools for Amazon sellers is an inspiring story of growth and adaptati...]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Hi there, this is Michael from Amazing FBA and welcome to Practical Hacks. If you subscribe to the philosophy that done is better than perfect, you're going to love these little hacks. Today we'll look at how to increase your Amazon seller profit margin.<br />
<br />
Do you want to grow your business bigger and faster? A free audit of your Amazon business can help you see and avoid threats and find missed golden opportunities. I generally charge per hour, but this would be free. You can be a reseller or a brand owner. All I ask is that you're doing a few thousand dollars a month in sales already.<br />
<br />
Just visit myamazonaudit. com, That's M Y A M A Z O N A U D I T dot com.<br />
<br />
Hi there folks, Michael Veazey here for another episode, this one's going to be a quick one<br />
<br />
I've got some insights from a recent audit I did for somebody who's got only one SKU, but been selling for about a year. So quite early stages. This person has got up to around two and a half thousand dollars in sales a month selling in the U S.<br />
<br />
So here was some insights from what is not untypical situation. There were spending quite a bit on hours and ads. The first thing is that this person was not really aware of one critical metric that I recommend everyone who is new ish on Amazon or new to e-commerce which the advertising to sales ratio or the TACOS =total advertising cost of sales. That is the same as the total advertising spend divided by the total sales of any given product.<br />
<br />
That's a useful metric by the way that predates Amazon selling by many decades. And I think it's a good one to keep an eye on across e-commerce or even retail generally.<br />
<br />
If your profit margin and your product accounting for all your direct costs- the cost of the product and your Amazon fulfillment costs- is say 30%. Then if you're spending more than 30% of your ad revenue on advertising, you are making zero profit.<br />
<br />
Sadly a common circumstance. If you are launching a new product line, perfectly acceptable to pay effectively for market share. If you're not however. In launch mode, then something needs to change drastically.<br />
<br />
So. That was the starting point of this audit that we did a few days ago.<br />
<br />
I did it personally, by the way, I didn't have my staff to it.<br />
<br />
One of the things to look at is why that number so high, the advertising to sales ratio. One reason for that often is a low conversion rate. That is to say the out of a hundred people visiting your listing, only a handful will buy .<br />
<br />
And it was true in this case, as I looked in the business reports, which if you go to Amazon Seller Central dashboard. You get a business reports under. Detailed sales page by ASIN. I think you need the one in this case by parent product. It says anyone product and it was about 8% unit session percentage, which is the number of units divided by the number of sessions. A session is roughly equivalent to visits to put it in simple tips.<br />
<br />
And if that number is low, that means that every time you spend money on an ad you pay per click as the name implies for that type of marketing, PPC. And therefore, if you have to get in this case, 8% means 12 clicks before you get a sale, then you paid for those 11 other clicks without a sale. So that really drives up the advertising to sales ratio, which is a critical number. And that strips out the profits.<br />
<br />
How to increase your Amazon Seller profit margin:<br />
Improve your Amazon Listing Conversion Rate<br />
Improve Star Rating<br />
---<br />
So how do we get that conversion rate higher? Well the easiest way is to work on your reviews. In this case, they had 4.8 star average. So that wasn't probably the issue.<br />
<br />
Lower Price<br />
---<br />
The price could be. Lowered. That obviously can strip out your profits of course, in a different way,]]></itunes:summary>

Amazon IS a nightmare at times. With Amazon Account Suspension, listing suspension and intellectual property violations all significant risks, itâ€™s a wise move for risk diversification. And with Amazon ads costs going up all the time, it seems like it might even make financial sense.<br />
<br />
However. once you're off Amazon you're confronted with another challenge: How on earth do I get quality traffic to my site? And how do I get enough of it to make a real business? So many Amazon sellers have a Shopify or woocommerce site that does almost nothing. Others pay so much for traffic in paid ads that they can't make a profit.<br />
<br />
Most serious DTC owners know that SEO has to be the backbone of traffic. But how do we actually go about SEO in a way that works? Today we talk with Farzad Rashidi of Respona on exactly how to get that precious Google organic traffic in a way thatâ€™s doable for busy entrepreneurs.<br />
