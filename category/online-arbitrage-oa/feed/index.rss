		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Robyn Johnson will be talking about the essentials and best practices for sourcing models.<br />
<br />
<br />
Background<br />
Robyn was not at all capitalist. She was a youth pastor - but “the benefits are out of this world” when working for the church. They had to test their son for diseases - her 1st thought was: “How do I keep my kid alive and not lose my house?”<br />
<br />
Robyn did the <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps">Dave Ramsey plan</a>. She went from Craigslist to eBay to Amazon, built $100 into a $1 Million business and became a sourcing models specialist. <br />
4 mainstream sourcing models for Resellers on Amazon<br />
<br />
 	Used Books, <br />
 	RA or OA, <br />
 	Wholesale<br />
 	Brand Management <br />
<br />
Used Books <br />
Quite a few people do multi-millions on this. <br />
<br />
The margins are great but it’s dirty physical work. <br />
<br />
If you have $100, $50K or $1M, you can start with used books; stay away from textbooks!<br />
<br />
They are a great way to learn the platform because you eliminate a lot of the learning curve. <br />
RA/Retail Arbitrage <br />
If you can’t do used books, this is the next easiest. <br />
<br />
You just go to a location - you need to be a treasure hunter.<br />
<br />
Either in person (RA)<br />
<br />
Or OA - Online Arbitrage. <br />
<br />
There can be IP and scalability issues. <br />
<br />
There are a couple of people doing this at scale but it’s challenging. <br />
<br />
Scaling OA past $250K mark will mean you have to create some new infrastructure. <br />
Wholesale ($1,000-$3,000 capital needed)<br />
This is often how people move into the next stage. <br />
<br />
It’s very delayed gratification- a lot of energy goes in and you’re not able to really check. <br />
<br />
You have to put a lot of leads in, and you have a lot of back and forth with brand owners. <br />
<br />
It takes 60-90 days to get approved for a brand. <br />
<br />
It will then take 3-6 weeks to get your first inventory into Amazon. <br />
<br />
You need to be analytical, happy with spreadsheets. You need someone steady and consistent. <br />
<br />
There’s no big roulette risk like PL. <br />
<br />
Robyn gets 60%+ margins on all her wholesale. But she goes through stacks of data! For example, she had a 7-foot high stack of brochures from suppliers from her last trade show visit.  <br />
Private Label $5K-20K <br />
Robyn has family from China - but doesn’t PL! This is high risk - so Robyn doesn’t want the risk. You have risks around IP or liability. But above all, you need to bring some value to the marketplace. <br />
<br />
Wholesale is blackjack, where PL is roulette. So you have to have to think about your risk tolerance. <br />
Brand management<br />
Usually, you’d need to start with value-added wholesale and get experience and case studies before transitioning over to this. <br />
How do you match the entrepreneur and the sourcing models?<br />
<br />
 	Cashflow<br />
 	Experience in job<br />
 	What’s working so far<br />
 	Physical abilities<br />
<br />
If someone is very analytical, they might be good at wholesale. Whereas for Brand management - you’ll have technical skills and people skills. <br />
Personality and Amazon sourcing models<br />
If someone’s very spontaneous and is willing to work very hard, they do well in RA and OA. <br />
<br />
For RA to scale up, you’ll need to talk to managers. <br />
<br />
OA people are probably more introverted and very analytical and data-centered. <br />
<br />
Wholesale works for people who push well through numbers. It helps to be extroverted at trade shows. <br />
<br />
Brand management is better for those who have done $250-500K on Amazon and have at least some case studies. <br />
Private Label<br />
For private label, you need super high-risk tolerance. <br />
<br />
