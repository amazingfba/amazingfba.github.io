		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<br />
<br />
Today Hai Mag, the CEO and cofounder of Eva will talk about how to do proper stock management with Eva. Eva is an “intelligent profit maximization platform for Amazon sellers”. Amazon stock management, also known as <a href="https://amazingfba.com/amazon-inventory-management">Amazon inventory management</a>, is not a sexy topic.  The sugar high of instant sales from advertising is more alluring. <br />
<br />
But great Amazon inventory management is absolutely central to making sustainable profits. And having sustained cash flow. Get it right and you've got a key element of a money-making machine. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of sellers limit themselves by not using the right tools for Amazon stock management. Above all, they have bits of information in different places. The most important thing for more established sellers is to create an integrated <a href="https://amazingfba.com/amazon-inventory-management">stock management system</a>. <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Amazon Stock management needs to be automated<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
If you're a seller with high numbers of SKUs to manage, you need to automate Amazon stock management. If you don't do it, you face several poor outcomes.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, you will  be missing out on $100,000s of lost sales if you go out of stock. Secondly, you're tying up cash - and increasing your working capital needs by $100,000s - if you have way too much stock. And thirdly, you are wasting a lot of management time on <a href="https://amazingfba.com/amazon-inventory-management">inventory management. </a>Time you should be spending to grow your business.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Integrating 3PLs into Amazon stock management<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Hai and his team have been creating "smart" 3PL warehouses. That means they have connected their warehouses to a central system that manages stock and demand. Meaning that the 3PLs automatically know when inventory needs to be pushed from the warehouse into FBA fulfilment centres. And they do this without the business operator having to make manual decisions. Or communicate manually.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.amazingfba.com/eva">Get a 15 day free trial of Eva's system here.</a><br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Good inventory management includes repricing and Amazon ads strategy<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Just as importantly, a good stock management system must account for other factors. If you operate stock management in a vacuum, you risk being overstocked or out of stock. One critical factor is pricing. Having a sophisticated dynamic repricer is powerful. But integrating that with <a href="https://amazingfba.com/amazon-inventory-management">amazon seller central inventory management </a> is much more powerful. Add in 3PLs feeding stock into Amazon and you have a powerful system for maximising profit.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
If you're running <a href="https://amazingfba.com/amazon-profit-analytics-with-hai-mag-of-eva-guru/">Amazon ads</a>, it's also vital to integrate Amazon ad strategy with <a href="https://amazingfba.com/amazon-inventory-management">stock control</a>. If you don't, you'll be spending money to drive yourself <a href="https://amazingfba.com/amazon-inventory-management">out of stock</a>! Which in turn will crater your sales and your profits AND your cash flow!<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
In short, the only way to go is to use an integrated inventory management system. Integrate pricing, stock management and Amazon ads and you're most of the way there. Add in intelligent and automated 3PLs feeding stock into FBA...and you've created a real profit-making machine!<br />
<br />
<br />
You'll Learn:<br />
<br />
 	* The classic errors of stock management<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[If the  lockdown  hit retail everywhere in the world in 2020 and 2021 is big news, there is another interesting trend happening more quietly in ecommerce. TO put it simply: despite the massive growth in Amazon sales - or possibly because of it - ecommerce sellers now have more to lose than ever before from Amazon account suspensions. And they are getting ever more frustrated with the lack of customer data from Amazon. <br />
<br />
The natural next step is to set up your own Shopify or Direct to Consumer (DTC) site. But what if there are other options that could move as many units - or possibly many more - and bring big profits? <br />
<br />
<br />
Step forward the B2B business to business model of selling your products to retailers, most of whom will have a physical store or network of physical retail locations. While not common and not as easy to start as the classic Shopify move, this has many upsides for someone with good product development abilities and or a great product.  Today’s guest, Paul Brooks, explores with Michael what the upsides are of this approach; and how to start approaching retailers successfully.<br />
