			<itunes:subtitle>Introduction In this episode of &quot;The E-commerce Leader&quot; podcast, hosted by Michael Veazey and Jason Miles, the panel (including Chris Green and Kyle Hamar) discusses common ecommerce myths and misconceptions about starting an e-commerce business.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Introduction<br />
In this episode of "The E-commerce Leader" podcast, hosted by Michael Veazey and Jason Miles, the panel (including Chris Green and Kyle Hamar) discusses common ecommerce myths and misconceptions about starting an e-commerce business. They emphasize the importance of adaptability, critical thinking, and practical experience in the entrepreneurial journey. The panel also touches on the reasons why small businesses fail and the significance of cash flow management. Let's dive into the key takeaways from this thought-provoking discussion.<br />
Myth 1: E-commerce is a System<br />
The biggest ecommerce myth of all. Chris Green, one of the panel members, shares his experience of helping people learn how to sell on platforms like eBay and Amazon.  It's a common misconception that e-commerce is a straightforward system where following a set of steps guarantees success. However, entrepreneurship and selling on online platforms are not that simple. It requires a deeper level of understanding, expertise, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Chris emphasizes the importance of gaining practical experience, trying different strategies, and accepting the risks involved in the process.<br />
Myth 2: Following a Guru's Steps<br />
Blindly  following gurus or step-by-step guides without critical thinking is a huge mistake. It is critical that entrepreneurs  think for themselves and develop their own understanding of the business. While guidance and mentorship can be valuable, it is essential to question and adapt strategies to fit individual circumstances. We would strongly encourage you to avoid relying solely on gurus and instead develop their own expertise through experience and continuous learning.<br />
Myth 3: Lack of Adaptability<br />
We all agree that one of the fundamental features of being an entrepreneur is adaptability.  Many small businesses fail due to a lack of adaptability and an inability to respond to changing market conditions. Constantly evaluating and adjusting strategies to stay ahead in the competitive e-commerce landscape is paramount. Adaptability, combined with hard work and critical thinking, is crucial for long-term success.<br />
Myth 4: Cash Flow Mismanagement<br />
While cash flow mismanagement is often cited as a reason for small business failure, we believe that it is a downstream problem resulting from more upstream issues. The lack of adaptability and the inability to think like an entrepreneur are the root causes of cash flow problems. By addressing these fundamental issues, entrepreneurs can better manage their cash flow and ensure the financial stability of their businesses.<br />
Conclusion<br />
In this episode of "The E-commerce Leader" podcast, we challenge common myths and misconceptions about starting an e-commerce business. What we think is critical is of adaptability, critical thinking, and practical experience in the entrepreneurial journey. By debunking these myths,  we hope to help you think for yourself, question conventional wisdom, and develop your own expertise. <br />
<br />
Remember, success in e-commerce requires continuous learning, adaptability, and a willingness to take risks.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What matters?<br />
<br />
 	*  Budget required. My rule of thumb: The monthly revenue at around position 6 ranking for a keyword should not exceed your initial budget for your first order (not including marketing costs or reorder)<br />
<br />
Eg $10K in bank, don’t go for markets where product in pos 6 much over $10K/mo<br />
<br />
 	*  Market share of competition <br />
<br />
If your top competitor has over 30-40% of market share, walk away <br />
<br />
 	*  Price<br />
<br />
Is there an obvious gap in the market? <br />
<br />
No space here for more detail but leave it with me and I’ll redo some of the videos by end oct.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Details<br />
So, we've got our list of keywords (around 130 of them)<br />
<br />
Well done!<br />
<br />
and we're now using jungle scout to analyze each keyword, but what we're struggling with, namely me (Jamie), is what to look for in the results, and what numbers - reviews, price per review - we should look for and whether this tells us it's a market we could enter.<br />
<br />
Okay I’ll try to clarify<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We're not so clear on what we're actually looking for in these numbers, ie, if we get a price per review of $18, is this a good number, or not? <br />
<br />
Revenue per review is what we’re looking for, not price just to be clear. <br />
<br />
As to whether it’s good or not - it’s all RELATIVE. Compare different keyword markets. In this case, the higher the better. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And should we be taking the opportunity score on JS into serious consideration, for example... one keyword we have is "Clear Polycarbonate Scoop", the Score is 7, but we can see it's being dominated by one products which has 47% of the market, and revenue per review is $11, so I would see this is a bad market to enter (dominated by one products, low revenue per review), but JS says otherwise.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Short answer - not really. If you’re really…shall we say pushed for time (I didn’t say “Lazy!” But) or if you want to outsource the work of raw data crunching to a VA, you could use the JS score as a crude metric. But really I’ve not found it highly useful. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Another example is the keyword "asian bamboo steamer" which has an opportunity score of 4, but looking into the numbers the revenue is spread out between the different sellers, and the revenue per view is $31. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So there are 3 elements here, let’s separate: <br />
<br />
opportunity score of 4, <br />
<br />
Ignore this<br />
<br />
but looking into the numbers the revenue is spread out between the different sellers, <br />
<br />
That’s a GOOD thing - you DON’T want a market dominated by one seller<br />
<br />
and the revenue per view is $31. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is all relative - see above - but it’s better than for example $18 as above. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One seller takes up only 13% of the total reviews,<br />
<br />
This is not a metric I’ve ever taught or been interested in. Whatever works for you is good, of course, but what does it tell you?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 so because it's not dominated by a few sellers, the revenue is spread out evenly, and there isn't a crazy amount of reviews to compete with, we would assume this is a pretty good market to enter.<br />
<br />
correct<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We're just after more explanation on what numbers, or pattern of numbers should we look out for. We really don't understand what the revenue per review is... well we can get a number but we don't know whether it is good or not.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Revenue per review is JUST a way of comparing markets. You seem hung up on it. It’s not actually that critical. It just gives another metric for competition level in a niche. <br />
<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Learn how to choose the best niche for you. Aaron Ross will be talking about nice-to-have and need-to-have for your niche.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aaron’s Background<br />
Aaron was in business to business SaaS (software platforms) but nailing a niche is universal to any business.<br />
<br />
He started at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/crm/what-is-crm/">Salesforce.com</a> and created the outbound selling function fro them and added $100M in revenue for them.<br />
<br />
After that, he ended up writing and publishing Predictable Revenue.  <br />
<br />
He is now co-CEO of a business with 50 people and $7 million in revenue this year.<br />
<br />
Plus a father of 9!<br />
<br />
Aaron’s specialism is finding the uniqueness of a business; taking existing businesses and helping them grow - or identifying why they don’t grow.  In all cases, there are universal issues.<br />
<br />
His mother also grosses about $1M a year on Amazon USA selling flower seeds and bulbs.<br />
<br />
She has been gardening for 20 years and has specialized knowledge and supplier relationships. Motivated by the IRS (US tax) debt!<br />
Why do entrepreneurs or would-be entrepreneurs resist niching down?<br />
We’re in a world of overwhelming. So messaging MUST be focussed to cut through the noise.<br />
<br />
If you had a radio station that played jazz and rock and classical, it would be very confusing. But a lot of entrepreneurs do this with their messaging.<br />
<br />
However,  entrepreneurs resist niching down, due to:<br />
<br />
 	* Fear of missing out.<br />
 	* Fear of being too small<br />
 	* Being too boring eg selling red spoons<br />
<br />
But once you’ve done it and realize the value of it, you will be more open to it.<br />
<br />
It’s SO much faster to scale with a clear message.<br />
<br />
It’s about human perception in the end.<br />
Different opportunities - how to prioritize and pick a niche<br />
It’s not necessarily to be a one-stop-shop - if it solves the pain of the customer, that’s okay.<br />
<br />
Aaron left <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/crm/what-is-crm/">SalesForce.com</a> in 2006 (and a year of M &amp; A) - he wanted to make a way of making as much money as possible.<br />
<br />
Aaron tried creating various businesses:<br />
<br />
“Unique Genius” - how to make money with your unique skills and personality<br />
<br />
“CEO Flow” - how to make mini-CEOs in your business.<br />
<br />
In 2011 Aaron got married, his wife had 2 kids already and then had another on the way.<br />
<br />
So I had to actually make money. And ended up increasing his personal income 10X.<br />
How to choose your niche<br />
Look at your opportunities:<br />
<br />
 	* Where do you have your strongest case?<br />
 	* What’s been proven to work?<br />
 	* What is profitable?<br />
<br />
Aaron had the most reputation in sales, plus expertise. Also, it was valuable to clients<br />
<br />
And thus profitable. This is why he ended up creating a successful, profitable business in the outbound sales in a B2B niche.<br />
Need to have vs. nice to have <br />
It’s hard to sell something to someone if they don’t perceive they have to have it.<br />
<br />
When have customers paid the most money and got the best value?<br />
Trust is premium<br />
<br />
 	* Anyone can make any claim they want.<br />
 	* They need to trust you can deliver on the promise.<br />
But the customer has to also trust that they personally can do it.<br />
<br />
For example, gain muscle ads - you have all the proof (mostly best successful customer studies) - that you can deliver on this.  But the consumer has to believe he can gain 20 pounds - but also possible for him too.<br />
<br />
Make it feel simple or doable - all the pieces in one physical package.<br />
<br />
Eg 1 Aaron just bought a basic piano keyboard with a seat, headphones, etc.<br />
<br />
